I&#039;ve written a B-tree in C and I&#039;m having a bit of trouble extending
br
it to take arbitrary keys/values. Mostly, I&#039;m having trouble with freeing the values whenever a delete occurs. I figure I&#039;ve got two options: require the
br
user to provide a free function that&#039;s called automatically on deletes, or 
br
just have delete return a pointer to the deleted value and let the user free
br
it however they want.
br

br
Anyone have any advice?

a href="#p71687587" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71687587

The first sounds more straight forward and less prone to bugs due to hidden logic desu.

Copy the user&#039;s data into the tree yourself and manage your own memory so the user doesn&#039;t have to?

a href="#p71687619" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71687619
/a

br
Yes, be consistent. If the rest of your btree functions copy user data then the btree should free it. If the user provided reference is what is kept in the btree, then the user should be responsible for freeing it.

a href="#p71687639" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71687639
/a

br
If the guy&#039;s a bro he implements both and supports it by providing an option during btree creation.

if by two types, you mean lists and vectors, those are just two subtypes of sequence. as long as anything is a proper sequence, then it qualifies.

Yes you can, but it is quite a slow way to learn. Online tutorials and experimentation, and Googling issues you have while programming - this is from my experience the best and quickest way to learn how to program. Of course, once you know one language, it&#039;s easy to learn another language that&#039;s of a similar type. For example, you could learn Python to a decent level from a couple of YouTube videos once you know C++.

a href="#p71690455" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71690455

br
To advance through the list, set cur to point to the next entry.
br
If you want to e.g. add a new node at the end, assuming you&#039;re at the end of the list already, just call malloc and put the returned pointer as the pointer to next in the current node.
I want to start programming and have a feeling Python is a meme. Should I start with C?

br
Each node has some data and a pointer. And you have a pointer &quot;head&quot; which you use to access the first node.
br

br
Adding a node:
br
If there are no nodes, create a new node with a pointer to null. Point the head to that node.
br
If there is a node, create a new node with a pointer to what the head points to. Point the head to that node.
br

br
A node lives in some random part of memory and you can access it with pointers.

ok anon i might take a look at learn python the hard way and go from there.

br
The thing I am most concerned about is not learning programming properly, &quot;in depth&quot;. I really don&#039;t want to blindly follow solutions for the problems I will face while not fully understand what I&#039;m doing. For example, we have a Debian and a pfSense server at work and I usually have to solve random problems that happen, or to implement some systems, simple things, but I don&#039;t have the slightest clue of what I&#039;m doing, I just google the problem or what I want to do, solve it find another problem, google it again, solve it, rinse and repeat. I feel like working my way through a book will make me more aware of the intrinsics of the language.
Noob here, how do I find projects to contribute?

do you have previous programming experience? if so just use their python docs and their tutorials they&#039;re really good. python is extremely quick to learn if you already know another language.

malloc allocates from heap not stack.


If I&#039;m pretty fluent in C# and Java (roughly 2 years experience, maybe 5 years programming in general), how hard will it be to become decent at C++? I&#039;m taking a course that requires &quot;fluency in C++&quot; as a pre-requisite, and I have about a month to prepare.

a href="#p71691226" class="quotelink"

It&#039;s allocated on the heap.
br
Duplicating that statement
br

pre class="prettyprint"
int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
br
int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
br

/pre

br
would be bad because you&#039;d be declaring p twice. However if you did
br

pre class="prettyprint"
int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
br
*p = malloc(sizeof(int));
br

/pre

br
this would also be bad because you can no longer free the first block of memory. You no longer have a pointer to it.
br
But yes, you will have a new block of memory somewhere else on the heap.
How can I compile something with jsoncpp via Makefile? Already tried those two. Can&#039;t find anything in the docs either.

Basically, it depends on how it&#039;s installed. There&#039;s a default value it pulls from, but otherwise you have to specify if it isn&#039;t in that default location.

I have one, it&#039;s really fucking great.
reading on it is great. software is lacking many useful features like marking a book as read. For some reason does not load cover images on some files. Actually does not load any in my case and i have about 1500 mobis loaded on it. There are no profiles as far as I know. Software comes in many language versions but not in mine of course - lets support some exotic eastern gibberish and completely ignore the fact that kindle is the most popular ebook reader in one of european countries.

Shit. If you read in the sun anyway instead of friends you are a friendless loser and it&#039;s suitable for you. If you have a higher than 30 IQ, you&#039;ll realize that it&#039;s only good for reading &quot;fun&quot; books and sucks for PDF and research or information books.

A tablet is unironically the best, especially AMOLED for reading at night. If you read at your computer just turn your screen 90 degrees to read in 9:16, way better than 4:3 or 1:1.

That was the kindle with the keyboard, newer models have a touchscreen. Someone got the new kindle for my grandmother. It mainly uses gestures to turn pages and stuff. She was utterly confused by it, she thought the books I put on it were samples because after a few pages it would go back to the beginning. She couldn&#039;t read the whole book.

It&#039;s one of the best ereaders out there. It&#039;s 100% amazon botnet but this can be avoided if you never enable wifi, which I did. Why the fuck would I want wifi on an ereader, anyway? I download and transfer all my books using calibre, works good. It&#039;s also durable, I had a sony and a kobo before and both broke down on me. However, as any e ink reader it&#039;s painfully slow, I can&#039;t believe you have to wait for a second for a page to draw graphs or scroll PDFs  in 2019 when its cost is over 100$.
br

br
It does have some shit formatting presets when reading .epub or pdfs.

br
all in all it&#039;s the best ereader I used, but until they fix the speed issues that plague all ereaders it will still be lacking.

I got the Kindle Oasis 7&quot; for this.  I have only read what&#039;s on Kindle unlimited though (not much animu, mostly American stuff.)  The Amazon bought comics will zoom and read panel by panel so you can read everything.  I&#039;d say  7&quot; is the bare minimum but anything larger is very expensive.  I think one of the competitors is coming out with a 7&quot; for $200 soon if you don&#039;t want to support Amazon.
I have different e-readers with displays from 6&quot; to 8&quot;. The Kindle Oasis with 7&quot; is the most comfy one and by far my favorite.

Honestly I&#039;d prefer to have some empty string and then concatenate Fizz and Buzz to it respectively if it&#039;s divisible by 3 and 5, then just print the number if the string&#039;s empty.

The exercise is to count up to 100, if your code involves &quot;101&quot; to reach 100 then it&#039;s immediately less readable.

So? It&#039;s not hard to encapsulate each step of a FizzBuzz to make it modular anyway.

pre class="prettyprint"
print(&#039; &#039;.join([&#039;fizz&#039;*(i%3==0) + &#039;buzz&#039;*(i%5==0) or str(i) for i in range (1, 101)]))

br
Look, if the exercise requires you to count to 100 and you&#039;ve used something that only equates to an &quot;&lt; 101&quot; operator, then it was a poor choice.

I&#039;ve heard people say that in C++ exceptions are cheaper than error codes because they&#039;re free when they don&#039;t trigger or something.

To me that doesn&#039;t make sense. Whatever mechanism that implements exceptions couldn&#039;t also implement error codes?

br
when you return from a function that returns an error code you must compare and branch 
br
with you return from a function that throws an exception you just keep going
br
when an exception is thrown however you get fucked up runtime callstack introspection which is slow as balls however

a href="#p71706162" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71706162
/a

br
It makes sense if you have 1 fail for 100000 non-fail situations. The stack-unwinding cost will be just amortized.
br
My problem with exception is the cost of programmers understanding the control flow. Java did the right thing demanding exceptions being part of function&#039;s signature. But pajeets were to stupid to understand and properly use and instead did the needful.

br
I am trying to turn Python-driven data analytics into a hobby outside of work, but I have learned that looking for nails (projects) to hit with a hammer (programming) is not the right way to think about programming.

br
monad transformers allow you to make a stack of different ways of handling errors in different parts of you system, they even let you have some kind of priority in them (you don&#039;t really care about the previous formatting error if you&#039;re out of memory)
br
what you&#039;re talking about is completely irrelevant, if your favourite language doesn&#039;t have a bifunctor class/trait you might as well kys.

I just feel disappointed when work is over because no gf to go home to
br
Programming is a great job but I get my fill at work and I have other hobbies I&#039;d rather do at home
br

Where my /programing as a hobby/ bros at?

a href="#p71706193" class="quotelink"

br

span class="quote"
&gt;when you return from a function that returns an error code you must compare and branch
/span

br
Yes I accept that in the case where the function is invisible to the compiler there can be complications like double checking.
br
But in other cases I don&#039;t really see it. Because any error will stem from some sort of error evaluation like:
br

pre class="prettyprint"
if(a==5) return -1; //oops, a can&#039;t be 5 here
br

/pre

br
Outside the function we define our error handling with an if that does a redundant check. For the compiler to eliminate the two it needs to know the function code. But if it does it already knows which branch we should go down and it can simply go there. Instead of returning to the location where we made the call to the function that returns an error code we could jump straight into the block catching the error. The compiler might have to reorder some things in some cases but I&#039;d deem the normal case as being trivial.
br

br
So in the non-error case (as determined inside the function) you just return and keep going as you say. It doesn&#039;t seem like anything that&#039;s inherent to exceptions or error codes. If I were to guess it&#039;s just the exceptions being assumed to be costly. That assumption is a lot harder when you&#039;re dealing with error code because they&#039;re really just ints. But the compiler do this if you just place an unlikely attribute around the error branch?

a href="#p71705740" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71705740
/a

br
I agree. The &#039;invisible control flow&#039; argument is for retards that can&#039;t into exception safety.

Is it just me who looks at this and says 
br

span class="quote"
&gt;Wow so elegant. I can&#039;t believe I used to do anything without writing a new class at every step
/span

br
And then you just rest blissfully knowing you need to consider partial state at every turn because you compile with exceptions enabled.
br

br
More seriously. This is a blatant overuse of global error handling. Exceptions and its devotees encourage that.
Small sql question, is the arrangement for checks important? 
br

Does it have the potential? Sure, it made huge strides in the last decade going from GIMP level to software that is actually on generally equal footing with others.
br
And while it is a very good overall package, but for specific areas I&#039;d still rather pick something like ZBrush, Substance Designer/Painter, Houdini, literally anything else for UVs, etc. The only edge in those areas Blender has is the very tight integration between its components, but that often doesn&#039;t make up for how much Blender lacks. 
br
Frankly, the biggest reason that Blender has gotten so good is that Autodesk has been totally slacking off for years. If they/some other company get their shit together, it could change again.

I&#039;ve heard people say that in C++ exceptions are cheaper than error codes because they&#039;re free when they don&#039;t trigger or something.

when you return from a function that returns an error code you must compare and branch

br
It makes sense if you have 1 fail for 100000 non-fail situations. The stack-unwinding cost will be just amortized.
br
My problem with exception is the cost of programmers understanding the control flow. Java did the right thing demanding exceptions being part of function&#039;s signature. But pajeets were to stupid to understand and properly use and instead did the needful.

monad transformers allow you to make a stack of different ways of handling errors in different parts of you system, they even let you have some kind of priority in them (you don&#039;t really care about the previous formatting error if you&#039;re out of memory)
br
what you&#039;re talking about is completely irrelevant, if your favourite language doesn&#039;t have a bifunctor class/trait you might as well kys.

br

span class="quote"
&gt;when you return from a function that returns an error code you must compare and branch
/span

br
Yes I accept that in the case where the function is invisible to the compiler there can be complications like double checking.
br
But in other cases I don&#039;t really see it. Because any error will stem from some sort of error evaluation like:
br

pre class="prettyprint"
if(a==5) return -1; //oops, a can&#039;t be 5 here
br

/pre

br
Outside the function we define our error handling with an if that does a redundant check. For the compiler to eliminate the two it needs to know the function code. But if it does it already knows which branch we should go down and it can simply go there. Instead of returning to the location where we made the call to the function that returns an error code we could jump straight into the block catching the error. The compiler might have to reorder some things in some cases but I&#039;d deem the normal case as being trivial.
br

br
So in the non-error case (as determined inside the function) you just return and keep going as you say. It doesn&#039;t seem like anything that&#039;s inherent to exceptions or error codes. If I were to guess it&#039;s just the exceptions being assumed to be costly. That assumption is a lot harder when you&#039;re dealing with error code because they&#039;re really just ints. But the compiler do this if you just place an unlikely attribute around the error branch?

a href="#p71705740" class="quotelink"

br
I agree. The &#039;invisible control flow&#039; argument is for retards that can&#039;t into exception safety.

/span

br
And then you just rest blissfully knowing you need to consider partial state at every turn because you compile with exceptions enabled.
br

br
More seriously. This is a blatant overuse of global error handling. Exceptions and its devotees encourage that.

I&#039;ve heard people say that in C++ exceptions are cheaper than error codes because they&#039;re free when they don&#039;t trigger or something.

To me that doesn&#039;t make sense. Whatever mechanism that implements exceptions couldn&#039;t also implement error codes?

when you return from a function that returns an error code you must compare and branch

br
It makes sense if you have 1 fail for 100000 non-fail situations. The stack-unwinding cost will be just amortized.
br
My problem with exception is the cost of programmers understanding the control flow. Java did the right thing demanding exceptions being part of function&#039;s signature. But pajeets were to stupid to understand and properly use and instead did the needful.

monad transformers allow you to make a stack of different ways of handling errors in different parts of you system, they even let you have some kind of priority in them (you don&#039;t really care about the previous formatting error if you&#039;re out of memory)

what you&#039;re talking about is completely irrelevant, if your favourite language doesn&#039;t have a bifunctor class/trait you might as well kys.

span class="quote"
&gt;when you return from a function that returns an error code you must compare and branch
/span

br
Yes I accept that in the case where the function is invisible to the compiler there can be complications like double checking.
br
But in other cases I don&#039;t really see it. Because any error will stem from some sort of error evaluation like:
br

pre class="prettyprint"
if(a==5) return -1; //oops, a can&#039;t be 5 here
br

/pre

br
Outside the function we define our error handling with an if that does a redundant check. For the compiler to eliminate the two it needs to know the function code. But if it does it already knows which branch we should go down and it can simply go there. Instead of returning to the location where we made the call to the function that returns an error code we could jump straight into the block catching the error. The compiler might have to reorder some things in some cases but I&#039;d deem the normal case as being trivial.
br

br
So in the non-error case (as determined inside the function) you just return and keep going as you say. It doesn&#039;t seem like anything that&#039;s inherent to exceptions or error codes. If I were to guess it&#039;s just the exceptions being assumed to be costly. That assumption is a lot harder when you&#039;re dealing with error code because they&#039;re really just ints. But the compiler do this if you just place an unlikely attribute around the error branch?

a href="#p71705740" class="quotelink"

br
I agree. The &#039;invisible control flow&#039; argument is for retards that can&#039;t into exception safety.

/span

br
And then you just rest blissfully knowing you need to consider partial state at every turn because you compile with exceptions enabled.
br

br
More seriously. This is a blatant overuse of global error handling. Exceptions and its devotees encourage that.

Does it have the potential? Sure, it made huge strides in the last decade going from GIMP level to software that is actually on generally equal footing with others.
br
And while it is a very good overall package, but for specific areas I&#039;d still rather pick something like ZBrush, Substance Designer/Painter, Houdini, literally anything else for UVs, etc. The only edge in those areas Blender has is the very tight integration between its components, but that often doesn&#039;t make up for how much Blender lacks. 
br
Frankly, the biggest reason that Blender has gotten so good is that Autodesk has been totally slacking off for years. If they/some other company get their shit together, it could change again.

#1 it&#039;s explicit

c++ syntax is a clusterfuck but in a sane language with mlish syntax it&#039;d be lean enough to invoke and use. outside of those domains it would be at least on par with the try-with-resources/using/with constructs poolangs give you. 
br
#2 you don&#039;t have to jump through insane hoops when you manually manage resource lifetimes. you just call init and close like you&#039;re used too. if you&#039;ve ever written anything approximating a standard library container you know what the problem here is.

&gt;&gt;71706632

br
I honestly think that&#039;s bad code in that it takes a pointer  given to it and calls delete on a pointer it didn&#039;t new.  Ownership should be clearly defined and what something does to a pointer should be expected.  The constructor should have only taken a value, and if the destructor is calling delete, made its own call to new.  RAII is there for you.
br

br
I get that it&#039;s a tutorial, but I think it teaches a bad habit.  Whenever possible, shit should be internal, and matched like HTML tags.  Don&#039;t make a thing over here and have it randomly deleted elsewhere.
br

br
Also, it wasn&#039;t clear to me why they didn&#039;t put g() inside of the try block, since it&#039;s what can throw.

I mean they probably expect you to do something with conditionals if you&#039;re this early but yeah the things I posted would allow you to extend this to bigger scopes and you also could count the number of arguments instead of having a dirty &quot;3&quot; in the middle.

/span

br
I wouldn&#039;t say that&#039;s the best strategy. If you follow some good rules you can stick to almost never breaking them and be excellent.
br
Sometimes arbitrary constraints that are pure inconvenience to apply helps you grow. But those should not be applied generally of course.
br

br
What&#039;s worth telling you with regards to this topic is that since programming is a craft/art and not a science you&#039;ll find people who advocate radically different ways of doing it passionately. It will be very difficult to tell as a newbie whats good advice and what isn&#039;t.
br
So think critically about what you&#039;re doing when you&#039;re following their advice and if it seems bonkers you should think about what you&#039;re getting out of it. If you can&#039;t come up with anything you should ask them or someone else.
br

br
There&#039;s a lot of things that are just tradeoffs as well. Maybe something makes you develop a prototype for whatever you&#039;re doing very but it then becomes next to impossible to build on. You should realize the costs and benefits in those situations.
br

br
Thinking about this post it&#039;s probably a bit further ahead than you are. It might not be all that applicable to a complete newbie. But as much as we ridicule them, the people who come into this thread not understanding why pointers need to exist have the potential to be great programmers if they put the time in.

No, Haskell&#039;s Either-likes is the only sane way to work with computations that can fail. Exceptions are yet another, invisible and requiring special syntax and runtime support to handle way to return value from a function.

br
I&#039;ve heard people say that in C++ exceptions are cheaper than error codes because they&#039;re free when they don&#039;t trigger or something.
br
To me that doesn&#039;t make sense. Whatever mechanism that implements exceptions couldn&#039;t also implement error codes?

a href="#p71706131" class="quotelink"

You are correct, they are not mutually exclusive. Exceptions are ok for things like division by zero (because it will be night fucking mare otherwise to do arithmetic)

br
when you return from a function that returns an error code you must compare and branch 
br
with you return from a function that throws an exception you just keep going

when an exception is thrown however you get fucked up runtime callstack introspection which is slow as balls however

a href="#p71706162" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71706162
/a

br
It makes sense if you have 1 fail for 100000 non-fail situations. The stack-unwinding cost will be just amortized.
br
My problem with exception is the cost of programmers understanding the control flow. Java did the right thing demanding exceptions being part of function&#039;s signature. But pajeets were to stupid to understand and properly use and instead did the needful.

monad transformers allow you to make a stack of different ways of handling errors in different parts of you system, they even let you have some kind of priority in them (you don&#039;t really care about the previous formatting error if you&#039;re out of memory)

what you&#039;re talking about is completely irrelevant, if your favourite language doesn&#039;t have a bifunctor class/trait you might as well kys.

br

span class="quote"
&gt;when you return from a function that returns an error code you must compare and branch
/span

br
Yes I accept that in the case where the function is invisible to the compiler there can be complications like double checking.
br
But in other cases I don&#039;t really see it. Because any error will stem from some sort of error evaluation like:
br

pre class="prettyprint"
if(a==5) return -1; //oops, a can&#039;t be 5 here
br

/pre

br
Outside the function we define our error handling with an if that does a redundant check. For the compiler to eliminate the two it needs to know the function code. But if it does it already knows which branch we should go down and it can simply go there. Instead of returning to the location where we made the call to the function that returns an error code we could jump straight into the block catching the error. The compiler might have to reorder some things in some cases but I&#039;d deem the normal case as being trivial.
br

br
So in the non-error case (as determined inside the function) you just return and keep going as you say. It doesn&#039;t seem like anything that&#039;s inherent to exceptions or error codes. If I were to guess it&#039;s just the exceptions being assumed to be costly. That assumption is a lot harder when you&#039;re dealing with error code because they&#039;re really just ints. But the compiler do this if you just place an unlikely attribute around the error branch?

a href="#p71705740" class="quotelink"

br
I agree. The &#039;invisible control flow&#039; argument is for retards that can&#039;t into exception safety.

/span

br
And then you just rest blissfully knowing you need to consider partial state at every turn because you compile with exceptions enabled.
br

br
More seriously. This is a blatant overuse of global error handling. Exceptions and its devotees encourage that.

You didn&#039;t even post a human, OP. I guess I have to take over for you.


I&#039;m so fucking horny for art hoes. I want to fuck a coked-out tumblr hipster DIY aesthetic astrology thot in her lip gloss DSL mouth. I want to cum all over a girl with thick frame glasses and edge dyed bobcat bangs. Everytime I hear a THICK, waist-high-jean-clad braindead choker-wearing slutty wiccan minx say &quot;yikes&quot;, &quot;y&#039;all&quot;, &quot;big mood&quot;, &quot;cancelled&quot; or &quot;this is a bop&quot;, I get an uncontrollable urge to run up to her and fondle her d cups and sweaty fat thighs. I want to pour my white olive oil onto her contoured cheeks and neotenous faces and rhinoplatisized nose. I want to finger an art hoe through her jean overalls while pretending to be interested as she talks about van gogh and arctic monkeys and how david foster wallace fans suck and gilles deleuze and VICE news and &#039;union pool&#039; in williamsburg and steven universe and homeopathy and saveur magazine and taking adderallto pass exams. IM SO. Fucking. Horny

The thing is, a big girl is going to fuck you extra hard because she&#039;s enthusiastic about it and doesn&#039;t want to lose you. Sex where the chick is enthusiastic is a lot different.

I have about three years of a job free life left. I am a stay at home parent whos interested in learning about programming in depth. I used to live in the bay area california, but I am still very close by. If you were me would you go back to school to study programming to get a degree, or would you learn it on your own fully? Also, what areas of programming should I focus on based on where I live? I want to take advantage of my location as much as possible and make every day studying count, so i want to choose the right path.

Programming classes will force you to do certain things just because.

New thread, new excitement from me that the numbers for my imported models vertex/normal elements seems to be correct. Converting from using a std::vector&lt;std::array&lt;float, 3&gt; &gt; to a std::vector&lt;glm::vec3&gt; made things much easier. Also converting the data structure I use for holding 3 vertices now uses an array instead of 3 separate members called vertex1, vertex2, vertex3. Woot!

I started by porting my low level C library to Rust. Those functions were unsafe since they did OS shit. Then I wrapped it up in a strongly typed interface.

the demand for *skilled* tech workers is huge, it&#039;s just not being met. the market is massively oversaturated with retards with degrees. i&#039;ve seen a job posting for a senior engine programmer position at bungie which listed &quot;experience with optimization&quot; under &quot;nice to haves&quot;. i mean jesus christ. ever think about how there were games on the 360/PS3 that ran at 60fps and looked good, and now it seems like the majority of console games are struggling to do the same on hardware with like 5 times the processing power and 16 times the memory? the industry is desperate for skilled workers, but they&#039;re not finding many thanks to the college bubble

br
which are instances of something (let&#039;s say a vote) so there can be multiple instances containing the same person but a different location where the vote came from. given the data is already loaded but i don&#039;t have access to it and i want to make a list of the candidates, what is the best way to do it? i thought about making an array matrix with [n][40] for n amount of candidates and going through it for every instance of the struct vector, checking if the names are equal to any already loaded in my array and loading it into a new place if not. But it seems inefficient, feels like if there&#039;s a lot of candidates and a lot of votes it would be slow as shit. I don&#039;t know any fancy libraries yet either, just the standard stuff and string. So what would be the best way to do this?

Why do you think it wouldn&#039;t work? Assuming your picture is correct, there are no circular dependencies. Imagine if instead of both the &quot;big function file class&quot; and &quot;main&quot; files importing from something you wrote, they imported something from the standard library, like os. If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;.
br

br
You need to watch out for circular dependencies in Python, though if your program even starts to run it probably means you don&#039;t have any.

I know. It&#039;s math. But if programming was like math we wouldn&#039;t have that argument. Point is that programming is very subjective and you use empirical results to show something is good.
Can someone help me understand this...
br

br
It seems to me that having variables defined outside the function scope is bad practice, unless you&#039;re using OOP.
br

br
Consider this in Java, which is completely acceptable because foo is an instance variable.
br

pre class="prettyprint"
class FooBar {
br
    int foo = 1
br
    public int fooBar(int bar) {
br
      return foo + bar;
br
    }
br
}
br

/pre

br
Now take the classless equivalent in Clojure (or JavaScript whatever).
br

pre class="prettyprint"
(def foo 1)
br
(defn foobar
br
    [bar]
br
    (+ foo bar))
br

/pre

br
It seems to me that foo should be defined in the function since they have no obvious relation other than being in the same file (whereas in OOP, they are related by class). This adds tight coupling...
br

br
However, this leads to a problem if foo is a variable shared by a bunch of other functions. So we&#039;re back to the problem of having a function tightly coupled with floating variables.

I was hoping for some sort of clever hashing solution where you collapse the key input range 1-10 to 1 and then do a lookup using that.

if the ranges dont overlap then that&#039;s a further optimisation you can make on the search because min and max values can be used to search

Is that the full complexity of the problem? Obviously the example you gave can be solved with an if-else. Are there going to be lots of those ranges? Can new ranges be added? I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a hash function to do this

It&#039;s technically a compiler but isn&#039;t it more an exercise in writing a parser?

br
Well if you were writing a compiler for a more complex language there&#039;s all sort of additional stuff to do like optimisation.

a href="#p71717760" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71717760

br
&quot;compiler&quot; is a pretty broad term that just means translating one programming language into another. but yeah because brainfuck is so simple, you get to skip many compilation stages and just directly translate each brainfuck command. the grammar is completely context-free. don&#039;t need syntax trees, state machines, regular expressions etc.

Question for native English speakers:

span class="quote"
&gt;f shall return a promise whose fulfilment indicates that the work is done.
/span

br

br
Is this grammatically correct English? How can the sentence be improved for readability?
People actually read dpt.txt?
br
For what purpose?

a href="#p71717884" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71717884

br
Sounds fine to me

a href="#p71717884" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71717884
/a

br
The word &quot;shall&quot; is used instead of will with the pronouns &quot;I&quot; (or &quot;we&quot;), for example
br

span class="quote"
&gt;I shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;We shall write code
/span

br

br
The following are wrong
br

span class="quote"
&gt;He shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;It shall write code
/span

br

br
But more importantly &quot;shall&quot;, in modern English, can simply be replaced with &quot;will&quot; on all occasions, otherwise you risk sounding pompous and archaic.
br

br
To improve readability, your sentence should actually not use &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;will&quot; but rather
br

br

span class="quote"
&gt;f returns a promise whose fulfilment indicates that the work is done.

I have about three years of a job free life left. I am a stay at home parent whos interested in learning about programming in depth. I used to live in the bay area california, but I am still very close by. If you were me would you go back to school to study programming to get a degree, or would you learn it on your own fully? Also, what areas of programming should I focus on based on where I live? I want to take advantage of my location as much as possible and make every day studying count, so i want to choose the right path.

New thread, new excitement from me that the numbers for my imported models vertex/normal elements seems to be correct. Converting from using a std::vector&lt;std::array&lt;float, 3&gt; &gt; to a std::vector&lt;glm::vec3&gt; made things much easier.

the demand for *skilled* tech workers is huge, it&#039;s just not being met. the market is massively oversaturated with retards with degrees. i&#039;ve seen a job posting for a senior engine programmer position at bungie which listed &quot;experience with optimization&quot; under &quot;nice to haves&quot;. i mean jesus christ. ever think about how there were games on the 360/PS3 that ran at 60fps and looked good, and now it seems like the majority of console games are struggling to do the same on hardware with like 5 times the processing power and 16 times the memory? the industry is desperate for skilled workers, but they&#039;re not finding many thanks to the college bubble

so in c, i have an array of structures with say

char sex;

char location[40];

br

br
which are instances of something (let&#039;s say a vote) so there can be multiple instances containing the same person but a different location where the vote came from. given the data is already loaded but i don&#039;t have access to it and i want to make a list of the candidates, what is the best way to do it? i thought about making an array matrix with [n][40] for n amount of candidates and going through it for every instance of the struct vector, checking if the names are equal to any already loaded in my array and loading it into a new place if not. But it seems inefficient, feels like if there&#039;s a lot of candidates and a lot of votes it would be slow as shit. I don&#039;t know any fancy libraries yet either, just the standard stuff and string. So what would be the best way to do this?

Why do you think it wouldn&#039;t work? Assuming your picture is correct, there are no circular dependencies. Imagine if instead of both the &quot;big function file class&quot; and &quot;main&quot; files importing from something you wrote, they imported something from the standard library, like os. If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;.
br

br
You need to watch out for circular dependencies in Python, though if your program even starts to run it probably means you don&#039;t have any.

I know. It&#039;s math. But if programming was like math we wouldn&#039;t have that argument. Point is that programming is very subjective and you use empirical results to show something is good.
Can someone help me understand this...
br

br
It seems to me that having variables defined outside the function scope is bad practice, unless you&#039;re using OOP.
br

br
Consider this in Java, which is completely acceptable because foo is an instance variable.
br

pre class="prettyprint"
class FooBar {
br
    int foo = 1
br
    public int fooBar(int bar) {
br
      return foo + bar;
br
    }
br
}
br

/pre

br
Now take the classless equivalent in Clojure (or JavaScript whatever).
br

pre class="prettyprint"
(def foo 1)
br
(defn foobar
br
    [bar]
br
    (+ foo bar))
br

/pre

br
It seems to me that foo should be defined in the function since they have no obvious relation other than being in the same file (whereas in OOP, they are related by class). This adds tight coupling...
br

br
However, this leads to a problem if foo is a variable shared by a bunch of other functions. So we&#039;re back to the problem of having a function tightly coupled with floating variables.

Are programmers more left leaning or right leaning, politically? I&#039;ve seen a pretty strong split. Like half are liberal SJW beta types, while the other half into Trump and the alt-right.

Pretty sure there&#039;s nothing inherent to programming that makes programmers left/right aligned.

It&#039;s more likely just the culture in the location where programmers are that dictate that.

a href="#p71717367" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71717367

br
So I would search the collection for a range containing my key and then extract the associated value?
br
Isn&#039;t it wiser to just record min and max in two sorted arrays and then search for where the value belongs in those and associate each min with an index to use for an array containing the value?
br

br
I was hoping for some sort of clever hashing solution where you collapse the key input range 1-10 to 1 and then do a lookup using that.
br

br
I have a lot of ranges to deal with.

You can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key, I dont quite understand your two sorted arrays idea, it doesn&#039;t sound like makes sense
br
if the ranges dont overlap then that&#039;s a further optimisation you can make on the search because min and max values can be used to search

No the ranges shouldn&#039;t overlap. I don&#039;t want two values returned from a lookup.
br

span class="quote"
&gt;you can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key
/span

br
I don&#039;t follow. When I do a lookup I will just have an integer. It might belong to one of the ranges in the set.
br
Are you saying that I should store the ranges somewhere and store the values separately using a map that uses the min and max as a key?
br
I&#039;m not all that concerned with the range-&gt;value step it&#039;s the key-&gt;range that I fear will take time.

Is that the full complexity of the problem? Obviously the example you gave can be solved with an if-else. Are there going to be lots of those ranges? Can new ranges be added? I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a hash function to do this

&quot;compiler&quot; is a pretty broad term that just means translating one programming language into another. but yeah because brainfuck is so simple, you get to skip many compilation stages and just directly translate each brainfuck command. the grammar is completely context-free. don&#039;t need syntax trees, state machines, regular expressions etc.

The word &quot;shall&quot; is used instead of will with the pronouns &quot;I&quot; (or &quot;we&quot;), for example
br

span class="quote"
&gt;I shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;We shall write code
/span

br

br
The following are wrong
br

span class="quote"
&gt;He shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;It shall write code
/span

br

br
But more importantly &quot;shall&quot;, in modern English, can simply be replaced with &quot;will&quot; on all occasions, otherwise you risk sounding pompous and archaic.
br

br
To improve readability, your sentence should actually not use &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;will&quot; but rather
br

br

span class="quote"
&gt;f returns a promise whose fulfilment indicates that the work is done.

I have about three years of a job free life left. I am a stay at home parent whos interested in learning about programming in depth. I used to live in the bay area california, but I am still very close by. If you were me would you go back to school to study programming to get a degree, or would you learn it on your own fully? Also, what areas of programming should I focus on based on where I live? I want to take advantage of my location as much as possible and make every day studying count, so i want to choose the right path.

There are going to be bullshit classes that have nothing to do with programming and is going to hinder your progress.

Programming classes will force you to do certain things just because.

New thread, new excitement from me that the numbers for my imported models vertex/normal elements seems to be correct. Converting from using a std::vector&lt;std::array&lt;float, 3&gt; &gt; to a std::vector&lt;glm::vec3&gt; made things much easier.

I started by porting my low level C library to Rust. Those functions were unsafe since they did OS shit. Then I wrapped it up in a strongly typed interface.

so in c, i have an array of structures with say
br

pre class="prettyprint"
struct stuff{
br
char name[40];
br
char sex;
br
char location[40];
br
}
/pre

br

br
which are instances of something (let&#039;s say a vote) so there can be multiple instances containing the same person but a different location where the vote came from. given the data is already loaded but i don&#039;t have access to it and i want to make a list of the candidates, what is the best way to do it? i thought about making an array matrix with [n][40] for n amount of candidates and going through it for every instance of the struct vector, checking if the names are equal to any already loaded in my array and loading it into a new place if not. But it seems inefficient, feels like if there&#039;s a lot of candidates and a lot of votes it would be slow as shit. I don&#039;t know any fancy libraries yet either, just the standard stuff and string. So what would be the best way to do this?

Why do you think it wouldn&#039;t work? Assuming your picture is correct, there are no circular dependencies. Imagine if instead of both the &quot;big function file class&quot; and &quot;main&quot; files importing from something you wrote, they imported something from the standard library, like os. If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;.
br

br
You need to watch out for circular dependencies in Python, though if your program even starts to run it probably means you don&#039;t have any.

I know. It&#039;s math. But if programming was like math we wouldn&#039;t have that argument. Point is that programming is very subjective and you use empirical results to show something is good.
Can someone help me understand this...
br

br
It seems to me that having variables defined outside the function scope is bad practice, unless you&#039;re using OOP.
br

br
Consider this in Java, which is completely acceptable because foo is an instance variable.
br

pre class="prettyprint"
class FooBar {
br
    int foo = 1
br
    public int fooBar(int bar) {
br
      return foo + bar;
br
    }
br
}
br

/pre

br
Now take the classless equivalent in Clojure (or JavaScript whatever).
br

pre class="prettyprint"
(def foo 1)
br
(defn foobar
br
    [bar]
br
    (+ foo bar))
br

/pre

br
It seems to me that foo should be defined in the function since they have no obvious relation other than being in the same file (whereas in OOP, they are related by class). This adds tight coupling...
br

br
However, this leads to a problem if foo is a variable shared by a bunch of other functions. So we&#039;re back to the problem of having a function tightly coupled with floating variables.

Is there a range based associative array?
are recursive-descent parsers the industry&#039;s standard?

a href="#p71717346" class="quotelink"

br
a collection of ranges

a href="#p71717367" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71717367
/a

br
So I would search the collection for a range containing my key and then extract the associated value?
br
Isn&#039;t it wiser to just record min and max in two sorted arrays and then search for where the value belongs in those and associate each min with an index to use for an array containing the value?
br

br
I was hoping for some sort of clever hashing solution where you collapse the key input range 1-10 to 1 and then do a lookup using that.
br

br
I have a lot of ranges to deal with.

a href="#p71717407" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71717407

br
You can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key, I dont quite understand your two sorted arrays idea, it doesn&#039;t sound like makes sense
br
if the ranges dont overlap then that&#039;s a further optimisation you can make on the search because min and max values can be used to search

No the ranges shouldn&#039;t overlap. I don&#039;t want two values returned from a lookup.
br

span class="quote"
&gt;you can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key
/span

br
I don&#039;t follow. When I do a lookup I will just have an integer. It might belong to one of the ranges in the set.
br
Are you saying that I should store the ranges somewhere and store the values separately using a map that uses the min and max as a key?
br
I&#039;m not all that concerned with the range-&gt;value step it&#039;s the key-&gt;range that I fear will take time.

Is that the full complexity of the problem? Obviously the example you gave can be solved with an if-else. Are there going to be lots of those ranges? Can new ranges be added? I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a hash function to do this

br
&quot;compiler&quot; is a pretty broad term that just means translating one programming language into another. but yeah because brainfuck is so simple, you get to skip many compilation stages and just directly translate each brainfuck command. the grammar is completely context-free. don&#039;t need syntax trees, state machines, regular expressions etc.

Question for native English speakers:

span class="quote"
&gt;f shall return a promise whose fulfilment indicates that the work is done.
/span

br

br
Is this grammatically correct English? How can the sentence be improved for readability?

br
For what purpose?

a href="#p71717884" class="quotelink"

Sounds fine to me

a href="#p71717884" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71717884

br
The word &quot;shall&quot; is used instead of will with the pronouns &quot;I&quot; (or &quot;we&quot;), for example
br

span class="quote"
&gt;I shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;We shall write code
/span

br

br
The following are wrong
br

span class="quote"
&gt;He shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;It shall write code
/span

br

br
But more importantly &quot;shall&quot;, in modern English, can simply be replaced with &quot;will&quot; on all occasions, otherwise you risk sounding pompous and archaic.
br

br
To improve readability, your sentence should actually not use &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;will&quot; but rather
br

br

span class="quote"
&gt;f returns a promise whose fulfilment indicates that the work is done.

I used to live in the bay area california, but I am still very close by. If you were me would you go back to school to study programming to get a degree, or would you learn it on your own fully?

the demand for *skilled* tech workers is huge, it&#039;s just not being met. the market is massively oversaturated with retards with degrees. i&#039;ve seen a job posting for a senior engine programmer position at bungie which listed &quot;experience with optimization&quot; under &quot;nice to haves&quot;. i mean jesus christ. ever think about how there were games on the 360/PS3 that ran at 60fps and looked good, and now it seems like the majority of console games are struggling to do the same on hardware with like 5 times the processing power and 16 times the memory? the industry is desperate for skilled workers, but they&#039;re not finding many thanks to the college bubble

char sex;
br
char location[40];

}

br

br
which are instances of something (let&#039;s say a vote) so there can be multiple instances containing the same person but a different location where the vote came from. given the data is already loaded but i don&#039;t have access to it and i want to make a list of the candidates, what is the best way to do it? i thought about making an array matrix with [n][40] for n amount of candidates and going through it for every instance of the struct vector, checking if the names are equal to any already loaded in my array and loading it into a new place if not. But it seems inefficient, feels like if there&#039;s a lot of candidates and a lot of votes it would be slow as shit. I don&#039;t know any fancy libraries yet either, just the standard stuff and string. So what would be the best way to do this?

Why do you think it wouldn&#039;t work? Assuming your picture is correct, there are no circular dependencies. Imagine if instead of both the &quot;big function file class&quot; and &quot;main&quot; files importing from something you wrote, they imported something from the standard library, like os. If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;.
br

br
You need to watch out for circular dependencies in Python, though if your program even starts to run it probably means you don&#039;t have any.

I know. It&#039;s math. But if programming was like math we wouldn&#039;t have that argument. Point is that programming is very subjective and you use empirical results to show something is good.
Can someone help me understand this...
br

br
It seems to me that having variables defined outside the function scope is bad practice, unless you&#039;re using OOP.
br

br
Consider this in Java, which is completely acceptable because foo is an instance variable.
br

pre class="prettyprint"
class FooBar {
br
    int foo = 1
br
    public int fooBar(int bar) {
br
      return foo + bar;
br
    }
br
}
br

/pre

br
Now take the classless equivalent in Clojure (or JavaScript whatever).
br

pre class="prettyprint"
(def foo 1)
br
(defn foobar
br
    [bar]
br
    (+ foo bar))
br

/pre

br
It seems to me that foo should be defined in the function since they have no obvious relation other than being in the same file (whereas in OOP, they are related by class). This adds tight coupling...
br

br
However, this leads to a problem if foo is a variable shared by a bunch of other functions. So we&#039;re back to the problem of having a function tightly coupled with floating variables.

So I would search the collection for a range containing my key and then extract the associated value?
br
Isn&#039;t it wiser to just record min and max in two sorted arrays and then search for where the value belongs in those and associate each min with an index to use for an array containing the value?
br

br
I was hoping for some sort of clever hashing solution where you collapse the key input range 1-10 to 1 and then do a lookup using that.
br

br
I have a lot of ranges to deal with.

You can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key, I dont quite understand your two sorted arrays idea, it doesn&#039;t sound like makes sense
br
if the ranges dont overlap then that&#039;s a further optimisation you can make on the search because min and max values can be used to search

&gt;you can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key

br
I don&#039;t follow. When I do a lookup I will just have an integer. It might belong to one of the ranges in the set.
br
Are you saying that I should store the ranges somewhere and store the values separately using a map that uses the min and max as a key?

I&#039;m not all that concerned with the range-&gt;value step it&#039;s the key-&gt;range that I fear will take time.

Is that the full complexity of the problem? Obviously the example you gave can be solved with an if-else. Are there going to be lots of those ranges? Can new ranges be added? I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a hash function to do this

The following are wrong

span class="quote"

br

span class="quote"

br
But more importantly &quot;shall&quot;, in modern English, can simply be replaced with &quot;will&quot; on all occasions, otherwise you risk sounding pompous and archaic.

This desu. Most of the zoomers I know of don&#039;t even fiddle with technology outside their phones and seldom play games. It&#039;s all fucking Netflix poison holy shit.

I&#039;m a millennial, and not only are computer games boring and for (man)children, but in my knowledge of tech is often inversely correlated with hours spent playing games.

Read my post and the post I was responding to, I was making an argument for the case that &quot;playing computer games&quot; is not correlated with knowing about computers at all. You know engineers that do play games, most engineers I know don&#039;t play games. I haven&#039;t played vidya since I was 17 years old.

If “milennials” cover the period from 1980-1999, then “zoomers” will be from 2000-2019. Anyway, it’s what the generation does that defines them, and considering that we simply call them gen z, because milennials are gen y etc, we should probably stop naming generations like that. Milennials and boomers sort of make sense, like the lost generation. But the others are just meaningless. Late gen x’ers have more in common with early millennials than early gen x’ers (who in turn are basically boomers).

gen z are fucking clueless when it comes to tech. yeah, they can use android tablets since birth or whatever but they can&#039;t do shit when it comes to troubleshooting and actually fixing shit. if it doesn&#039;t work out of the box, or if it breaks, the gen z way is to just throw it away and get something newer and flashier.

The same applies for my boomer dad though. He can’t fix stuff at all. It’s a symptom of prosperity rather than one of generation, when you have money to waste you are never forced to care about fixing broken things.

br
I was born in &#039;91 and was taught to fix stuff and re-use old tech etc. by my grandad who was born in the early 50&#039;s and grew up in post WW2 war torn Europe so I guess your theory holds at least some water. My dad is pretty useless with tech and will generally get other people to fix it or just bug me about it.

Read the rest of my post. The previous generations were named after what they did. Lost generation = a whole generation damaged by the Great War, baby boomers = enjoying the newfound stability and prosperity in the west after the war and having loads of children, generation x = disaffectionate and directionless.. gen y and z are terrible names, at least we can say milennials for this generation.

Frick I&#039;m a zoomer
years ago, people were saying that all these kids growing up around technology would be smarter and more tech-savvy than any generation before them, the opposite happened, they use the tech, but have no interest in how it works, tech support industry is still booming because none of them know how to fix anything, they have lived their lives being handed everything on a silver platter and never questioned where it came from

as a zoomer, the reason I watched other people play games was because I didn&#039;t have a PC strong enough to play said games, and I was too shy to ask my dad to buy me a PC or games which I could run.
br

br
To be honest, it was my dad that brought me into computers, gave me my own, and coincidentally introduced me to pirating, modding, getting a virus, and removing it without his help. I had managed to crack my 3DS with relative ease and played all the games I wanted without having him spend a cent. 
br
I&#039;m kinda glad he showed me tech at such a young age because I&#039;m 1000x better off than my peers when it comes to technology and troubleshooting

Sure, thinking that people are going to get into computers simply because computers are around was retarded, but i really expected more than that. It&#039;s literally a downgrade, computers became a humanity&#039;s bitch instead the other way around, modern kids have so much easily consumable distractions around and so little good content that provoking them to do anything constructive is next to impossible. Or maybe i just haven&#039;t saw any good kids yet. i&#039;m sure someone will grow up to be a nerd in modern environment, maybe i&#039;m just biased and for some dumb reason i expect anyone who uses computer to be one of my kind.

as far as technology goes (disregarding &quot;the evil normies!11&quot;) they&#039;re honestly mostly the same, every gen after mid-gen-y has had access to the internet from an early age and as a result had access to the same information, tho if i had to pick one it&#039;s prob gen y as far as people who are &quot;better with technology&quot; on average

Windows XP wasn&#039;t good until SP2. Windows 98 was shit but it became more or less stable by 2001. I made the switch to Windows XP in 2004-05 from Windows 98, I got into the habit of leaving my computer 24/7, after about 3 months of this I had my friend come over and he was like &quot;Holy fuck you&#039;re out of your mind for leaving it on for 3 months straight, Windows 98 will destroy itself the second you turn it off.&quot; Maybe a week later I had to reboot it for some reason, maybe video driver updates. The install died, it would hit the Windows 98 splash page indicating it was loading and then just hang. So I figured I may as well update to Windows XP since I heard from other gamers that it was excellent. I ran XP until Windows 7 came out then once Windows 8 came out I went full Linux.

If this thread follows usual &quot;proper&quot; generation then you guys are forgetting about Gen alpha (2010 upwards)

Ready the manga instead. Most kino rollercoaster of all time.
Do not watch this fucking curse of a show. I thought i was way to desensitized to shit and then the final episodes of this monstrosity (by how horrifying it is, it&#039;s actually really good but fuck it) left me a goddamn mess. Spare yourself.

Writing&#039;s fine. It&#039;s taking forever because the artwork is of ridiculous quality, and the author keeps making it more and more detailed with each chapter and has no interest in downgrading for the sake of speeding up releases.

&gt;&gt;117550167

br
Very detailed artstyle, arguably top5 in terms of detail in current manga. Miura also switched to digital art, which somewhat increased the pace of his work, but some argue that it was to the detriment of the art quality. Furthermore the burnout and insane working schedules in japanese manga are no secret, see togashi. 
br

br
From what I remember, Miura also doesn&#039;t rely on assistants that much, thus most of his work is 100% his own.
br

br
Just treat yourself and read it. The first 2,5 volumes are a bit iffy in terms of art but then, there&#039;s a flashback arc where it gets kino.
br

br
if you want to check similiar manga, check vinland saga (completed, vikings) or vagabond (unfinished, but amazing- basically Edo period samurai)

br
It&#039;s crazy how big of a bump in quality the series gets when the Golden Age arc starts. I couldn&#039;t believe my eyes by the time the Conviction art started. Crazy how someone can maintain that level of quality for so long.
I finished the anime and longed for more...couldn&#039;t believe it ran for such a short time. I felt insulted with those terrible remakes with all the awkward overuse of CGI. What kind of cashgrab was that

br
Do you wanna watch it or not? Fucking hell.

a href="#p117550167" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;117550167

br
The reason is that every single page is drawn with this level of detail.

a href="#p117550369" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;117550369

br
yeah, that&#039;s why I urge many to stay reading. Never had heard of anyone who quit as soon as golden age started.
br

br
For reference, this is a small panel from a manga he did, when he was allegedly 10-12 years old. I wouldn&#039;t call myself a great artist or art expert, but this really looks like the work of a prodigy.

I can believe it. The Berserk Prototype was much higher quality than the initital Black Swordsman arc. He&#039;s incredibly skilled. Giganto Maxia is some of his best work, artwork-wise.

a href="#p117550167" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;117550167
/a

br
He&#039;s 1 guy drawing a story over decades, over time I imagine interests and passions change quite drastically. Usually it&#039;s a passion thing. Everyone wants to see the end, while he lost his direction years ago.

a href="#p117549989" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;117549989
/a

br
Never. According to the official guidebook, Guts is 6&#039;7, 265 lbs of raw muscle, and his sword weighs more than he does. Live action would be retarded.

a href="#p117550695" class="quotelink"

Even in the official material hasn’t his height varied quite a lot?

a href="#p117550774" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;117550774
/a

br
I mean there are huge hunks of meat like The Mountain in GOT, but one would be hard pressed to find an actor that could properly convey the emotional heft of guts. 
br

br
Best bet would be someone like Dave Bautista or Tom Hardy.

I love how you brush the guy who played the mountain away but assume that faggot that played a dipshit character in a children&#039;s movie and then had a five minute cameo in BR is somehow capable of acting with anything close to emotion.

i dont know, some recent chapters look worse. people often blame the fact that he switched to digital.

a href="#p117550989" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;117550989
/a

br
Guts&#039; physique isn&#039;t achievable, especially not by a good actor who also looks like him and doesn&#039;t dedicate his life to lifting. Live action is always shit. We don&#039;t want it.
The deluxe volumes look soooo good. I wish they would pick up the pace on releasing them.
br
I want to reread golden age and lost children but going back to scans feels like such a downgrade now.

a href="#p117550989" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;117550989

br
I feel like there’s potential with Tom hardy but you’d need to do some serious forced persepectivd to capture guts’ stature

br
No I like Björnsson very much, but he is primarily a very physical actor without say the charisma of Arnold. Bautista isn&#039;t ideal but the closest thing we have of acting/physical prowess. While I&#039;m not the biggest fan of GOTG, many actually praised his Drax performance - the quippyness is mostly script/tone but otherwise he could work, but as stated would only be the next best thing.
br

br
Otherwise there&#039;s no one else around currently. Hardy would be too small and would need to pack serious meat, more than his Bane in order to become a contender. So you end up with needing to cast a (semi-pro bodybuilder/powerlifter with acting talent, which in itself narrows down the field to very very few, unless you consider The Rock to be a serious actor, which would be laughable, at least for the material.
br

br
Casting this whole thing would be unenvyable, very much so that it would be almost impossible, if fans expectations and source material are kept in mind.

Not really if you don&#039;t overvolt, or have really high temps.

Basically undervolt is only good if you have a shitty cooler or a case with poor airflow, if you have the thermal headroom crack that shit up.

why and for what? That 1920X is such a waste considering Ryzen 3000 is bringing far superior IPC, power efficiency, and has the same core count. What are you doing that NEEDS Quad channel? Gaming doesn&#039;t count.
Why are there no listings for X570 boards or Zen 2 CPUs yet?

a..all of them? Regardless of their clock speeds, 3xxx Ryzen will have better IPC than their 2xxx and 1xxx series chips. Also clock for clock, the 3xxx series will outperform the older stuff by anywhere from 6% to 15%.

It&#039;s OK provided you have a desk with enough depth to have the monitor decently far away. I had a normal desk with a Samsung 32&quot; 1440p panel that I found myself actually turning my head back and forth to actually see everything in a game.

you&#039;re best bet is to get low latency. CL14 3200MHz will fair better than CL17 3600MHz. Better than CL16 3400MHz.

br
well the 3600X is going to be a 105w tdp 6c12t chip while the 3700X is a 65w tdp 8c16t. The higher tdp on the 3600X MAY point to higher OC ceiling potential. If you don&#039;t need the cores, the 3700X wouldn&#039;t be up your alley.

a href="#p71713222" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71713222
/a

br
that&#039;s because at anything above 3733MHz, the Infinity Fabric goes into 2:1 mode instead of 1:1. Up to 3733MHz, the IF will run at 3733MHz. Anything beyond that, it runs at half the rated speed. So even 5000MHz DDR4 will only provide 2500MHz IF speed.

a href="#p71713263" class="quotelink"

a href="#p71713198" class="quotelink"

br
I know aircoolers just werk. However, My case comes with 2 fans, because they are shitty case fans I&#039;ll probably just keep them but run them at lower RPM. 
br

br
The way my case is laid out, it&#039;s best for me to have 3 intakes in the front. If I buy an air cooler, that cools the CPU, sure. However, if I can get a 240+ AIO, it cools the CPU and acts as an intake fan. 
br

br
So, the equation isn&#039;t AIO vs air cooler. It&#039;s AIO vs air cooler + however many case fans the AIO replaced. 
br

br
I&#039;ll probably just end up paying extra and getting all quiet air fans and forgetting about AIO, but I&#039;ve crunched the numbers and the deepcool is better value in terms of cost. Plus, the Deepcool castle/captain has objectively good reviews, I was wondering if this lower model had some of the properties of the newer one. 
br

br
Also, the pumps of any AIO are virtually silent. Any noise that comes from them would be due to turbulent air, which would not be a problem because the rad would be mounted above the pump (on the front as an intake).

No no. You DO NOT want to have hot air being dumped into the case. You&#039;re placing too much about the airflow/air cooling. I&#039;ve run cases with absolutely not case fans at all and the CPU cooler fared fine. Again, what are you cooling? Overclocked? The money you&#039;re going to spend on a shit tier AiO just seems a waste to me.

Well you&#039;re kind of a unique case because if you&#039;re using the APU iGPU, RAM speed is your VRAM. So I guess get the fastest speed you can but I wouldn&#039;t leave CL17.

Is that really what happens or is it say the 267 mhz beyond 3733 mhz in a 4000mhz stick is only good for 133 mhz?

If that&#039;s the case, why would people even buy RAM higher than 3733 mhz? Or is underclocking an alternative way to get desirable RAM speed/latency?

yes, but how it interacts with Ryzen Infinity fabric is different. Look at the chart posted before and it shows that the IF latency is the same with CL14 3200MHz and CL16 3600MHz. Even CL17 3733MHz is only a tiny bit better.
br

a href="#p71713341" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71713341
/a

br
Nope. According to the chart, as soon as you exceed 3733MHz, IF drops to 2:1 automatically. 
br

span class="quote"
&gt;Why would people buy RAM higher than 3733MHz?
/span

br
The infinity fabric latency is only relevant for gaming and latency sensitive stuff. Other programs out there who simply prefer the raw bandwidth of CL18 4400MHz RAM will benefit from the overall faster RAM regardless of IF latency.

Yea Threadripper always had it. I don&#039;t even think TR2 was able to properly hand 4 sticks of RAM over 3600MHz half the time. The problem was the IF overall being latency intensive regardless of RAM speed. Which is why 1:1 is such an achievement for Ryzen 3xxx.

Just a 65w chip, not really overclocking. The case is tempered glass and doesn&#039;t have good airflow, the glass is translucent so you can&#039;t see inside so I&#039;m not necessarily going for aesthetics.

I&#039;d still need to put at least one fan in the front as intake, right?

What? You see the 1:1 and 2:1 at the bottom of the chart right? DDR4 4400MHz CL18 has worse latency than even CL14 3200MHz. CL17 3733MHz is only 2ns better than that. Their highest recommended is 3600MHz CL16 because it&#039;s the cheapest option compared to B-die based CL14 3200MHz and CL17 3733MHz.

yup sorry anon.
I wonder what the difference in performance would be with the Patriot Extreme Performance Viper 4 kit that was recommended in an earlier thread, where they use the timing:
br
CL17 - 17-19-19-39
br
Where as other name brands use the timing:
br
CL17 - 17-17-17-37
br
and yes it is given that the patriot kit is roughly half the price, but how big would the performance hit be.

a href="#p71713552" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71713552
/a

br
Very little, the other timings have an almost negligble impact on performance. What really always matters is clockspeed and CAS latency.

a href="#p71713476" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71713476

br
This is kind of blowing my mind, I always see these builds of people with mid-tier chips and safe overclocks stuffing their cases full of fans. I see a lot of builds use AIOs as intakes, is that shit just for aesthetics? 
br

br
Looking into this now, there are so many videos on youtube proving that case fans don&#039;t matter if air is constricted by the case anyway. 
br

br
So the best plan of action would be to add a brettygud aircooler? I could rig a way for the front to let in more air, but for a 65w chip I guess who cares? I&#039;d just be spending more money on fans. 
br

br
What BQ cooler is that? Pure rock? Do you think a low profile one like an L9i/a would work? I&#039;m not a fan of having to take off or work around very large air coolers.

br
It&#039;s 2ns every time the core needs something from memory, that&#039;s not in cache.
br
Though, not exactly true, due to speculative execution. This stuff gets fudged a lot. 
br

br
But games are the applications which are the most memory latency intensive because they are horribly poorly programmed and are accessing memory (or cache) repeatedly each frame, many times per second.
br

br
That&#039;s why going from 10ns to 8ns true memory latency (formula is in the OP), a 20% reduction, 2ns, can get you 10-20% increases in FPS.  Compare that to overclocking where going from 4GHz to 5GHz, a 20% increase, generally only gets you 1-5% gains in games because those extra clock cycles are just idle waiting on memory anyway. Hell, overclocking CPU can even make performance worse in games due to throttling.
br

br
see the 2933 CL14 vs CL16. That&#039;s a 1.35ns difference in latency, almost 15%, and the difference in 1% minimums is almost 10%.

br
I use 32GB myself, but that&#039;s because I need it for work and can take the sacrifice in gaming speed.

AMD is fucking garbage. Everything they make is absolutely, objectively crappy as shit and only a fat neckbeard would buy this shit-tier crappy shit because he&#039;s afraid of running out of autismbux (because God forbid he spend less money on Taco Bell and Mountain Dew.) I tried building an AMD gaming rig once and it was the worst experience of my life. First off, that CPU clip is fucking impossible to use. It looks just like an old Pentium CPU clip, but it&#039;s autistically retarded and I couldn&#039;t deal with it. And the graphics card was so fucking huge, I had to cut a hole all the way around my case to fit it in. Fucking AMD.
br

br
But wait, that&#039;s not even the best part! When I tried to start up my shitty autismbox (which I sold to the Association of Retarded Citizens BTW) the absolutely massive power draw dimmed every light in my house and throughout the entire neighborhood like I was firing up fucking ENIAC in the 1920s or some bullshit. I had plenty of time to worry about my power bill too, because this shitty thing couldn&#039;t figure out which of its 32 CPU cores to use and it took half a day to boot. As soon as I tried to play a game (fucking Starcraft from 1998), it lagged so hard it went backwards. I thought I should try downloading a driver, but there aren&#039;t any. There are no fucking drivers. What the shit, AMD? No wonder Apple doesn&#039;t use your shit. It wasn&#039;t long after that that I realized this thing was putting out more heat than a goddamn jet engine and it burned my house down.
br

Two weeks later, when I sold that piece of shit, I built an Intel/Nvidia rig! Holy shit, it&#039;s like jacking into the Matrix! I built it 5 years ago and it still runs every game in 4K at 240 FPS while using no power and it actually cools my house during the summer. What a beautiful machine, I seriously hope none of you are poor and stupid enough to buy AMD.

I have used the LG 32GK650F-B for gaming on console for a few months now and it served me well, but I&#039;m switching back to PC gaming, so it will stand on my desk instead of mounted to the wall.

Is nvme worth the premium? I checked some comparisons of loading times and in most games they were basically the same with a few huge games like GTAV offering maybe 5-7 seconds faster speed but what about installation, where it should excel? The only comparison I found was a Windows installation where it took 5:09 instead of 5:32 but are there any comparisons of installation of big games which should theoretically offer even larger differences.

you are going to be limited in your internet connection or CPU to extract the files before you get cucked by drive speed unless you are copy pasting a game, if you are just gaming is better to get double the capacity with a SATA ssd rather than the extra speed from nvme

I still expect an OC&#039;d 9900k to barely edge out AMD, but I think the 3950x will be the point AMD takes the performance crown. But if the 3600 really comes close to a stock 9900 then AMD sort of wins by default. You&#039;d have to be insane to go with a $500 processor when a $200 one is almost just as good. Intel would have half the price on every processor at that point to stay competitive, but again we won&#039;t really know tell the 7th.

I know I need more than 16GB of RAM because I do enough rendering and video editing, the next logical step is 32GB. What&#039;s the ideal speed I should look for? I&#039;ll probably get one of those Zen2 CPUs soon.

499$ i believe for reference and prob 50-100 more for 3rd party coolers was gonna get a 2070 super but this 2080 just has a super sale for 579$ for the zotac one

How long is the sale for? Because I&#039;d wager that non-Super 2080s will get cheaper anyway later on in the month when the 2080 Super is released too

in favor of who though?
can someone assemble me a PC all from cheap chink parts that will run modern games at 1080p? they don&#039;t have to run perfectly or at high settings, just acceptable. i&#039;m fine with the parts being of questionable quality and shit, i&#039;ll just get a reputable PSU so I don&#039;t explode.

2070 a-die already got within 10% of the 2080 when overclocked. Super is just 5% better. the &quot;10-15% better&quot; is only compared to the shit cards and not the FE. Was really manipulative how they framed it. You can see that in that same picture above.

Depends how much you cheap out. You generally can&#039;t get a &quot;good&quot; AM4 board for under $90-$110 except for some sales.
br
Steel Legend, TUF gaming pro, and Tomahawk are good choices. Especially the later since you can flash the BIOS without a CPU but the former 2 also have their own good features. You just don&#039;t get everything in a budget board and have to pick and chose. The $300+ boards typically have everything (but varying RAM compat, VRMs, BIOS still)

Why spend more when that meets your goals?

br
You can spend 50% more and you&#039;ll only get a 10-15% performance increase. Not worth it.

Add on a 2TB 3D-QLC SSD if you want to spend more money and actually get something useful out of it.
br
You could get an X570 board and 3600 as well, but there&#039;s no reason to when the 2600 will do 75fps fine and you&#039;re not going to use all those PCIe 4.0 lanes from X570.

That doesn&#039;t mean you HAVE to buy RAM validated to run at 3733 MHz; that&#039;s just a waste of money.

It is but if you&#039;re buying it for Ryzen 3000 series CPUs I&#039;d say give it a miss unless you already have a Ryzen processor. Can&#039;t update the BIOS to support 3000 series Ryzen without another CPU to temporarily put in it.

Not really if you don&#039;t overvolt, or have really high temps.

Basically undervolt is only good if you have a shitty cooler or a case with poor airflow, if you have the thermal headroom crack that shit up.

you&#039;re best bet is to get low latency. CL14 3200MHz will fair better than CL17 3600MHz. Better than CL16 3400MHz.

br
well the 3600X is going to be a 105w tdp 6c12t chip while the 3700X is a 65w tdp 8c16t. The higher tdp on the 3600X MAY point to higher OC ceiling potential. If you don&#039;t need the cores, the 3700X wouldn&#039;t be up your alley.

well that&#039;s up to you. I gave my 32&quot; 1440p monitor to a friend as a gift and replaced it with a 23.8&quot; 1440p 165HZ panel. I personally never noticed any crazy blur or anything.

Why haven&#039;t you killed yourself yet?

a href="#p71713222" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71713222
/a

br
that&#039;s because at anything above 3733MHz, the Infinity Fabric goes into 2:1 mode instead of 1:1. Up to 3733MHz, the IF will run at 3733MHz. Anything beyond that, it runs at half the rated speed. So even 5000MHz DDR4 will only provide 2500MHz IF speed.

a href="#p71713263" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71713263
/a

br
why would I?

a href="#p71713198" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71713198
/a

br
I know aircoolers just werk. However, My case comes with 2 fans, because they are shitty case fans I&#039;ll probably just keep them but run them at lower RPM. 
br

br
The way my case is laid out, it&#039;s best for me to have 3 intakes in the front. If I buy an air cooler, that cools the CPU, sure. However, if I can get a 240+ AIO, it cools the CPU and acts as an intake fan. 
br

br
So, the equation isn&#039;t AIO vs air cooler. It&#039;s AIO vs air cooler + however many case fans the AIO replaced. 
br

br
I&#039;ll probably just end up paying extra and getting all quiet air fans and forgetting about AIO, but I&#039;ve crunched the numbers and the deepcool is better value in terms of cost. Plus, the Deepcool castle/captain has objectively good reviews, I was wondering if this lower model had some of the properties of the newer one. 
br

br
Also, the pumps of any AIO are virtually silent. Any noise that comes from them would be due to turbulent air, which would not be a problem because the rad would be mounted above the pump (on the front as an intake).

/span

br
No no. You DO NOT want to have hot air being dumped into the case. You&#039;re placing too much about the airflow/air cooling. I&#039;ve run cases with absolutely not case fans at all and the CPU cooler fared fine. Again, what are you cooling? Overclocked? The money you&#039;re going to spend on a shit tier AiO just seems a waste to me.

a href="#p71713298" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71713298
/a

br
Well you&#039;re kind of a unique case because if you&#039;re using the APU iGPU, RAM speed is your VRAM. So I guess get the fastest speed you can but I wouldn&#039;t leave CL17.

br
Is that really what happens or is it say the 267 mhz beyond 3733 mhz in a 4000mhz stick is only good for 133 mhz?

If that&#039;s the case, why would people even buy RAM higher than 3733 mhz? Or is underclocking an alternative way to get desirable RAM speed/latency?

yes, but how it interacts with Ryzen Infinity fabric is different. Look at the chart posted before and it shows that the IF latency is the same with CL14 3200MHz and CL16 3600MHz. Even CL17 3733MHz is only a tiny bit better.
br

a href="#p71713341" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71713341
/a

br
Nope. According to the chart, as soon as you exceed 3733MHz, IF drops to 2:1 automatically. 
br

span class="quote"
&gt;Why would people buy RAM higher than 3733MHz?
/span

br
The infinity fabric latency is only relevant for gaming and latency sensitive stuff. Other programs out there who simply prefer the raw bandwidth of CL18 4400MHz RAM will benefit from the overall faster RAM regardless of IF latency.

Yea Threadripper always had it. I don&#039;t even think TR2 was able to properly hand 4 sticks of RAM over 3600MHz half the time. The problem was the IF overall being latency intensive regardless of RAM speed. Which is why 1:1 is such an achievement for Ryzen 3xxx.

Just a 65w chip, not really overclocking. The case is tempered glass and doesn&#039;t have good airflow, the glass is translucent so you can&#039;t see inside so I&#039;m not necessarily going for aesthetics.

&gt;Yeah but on that same pic they recommend getting the fastest ram for Ryzen.
/span

br
What? You see the 1:1 and 2:1 at the bottom of the chart right? DDR4 4400MHz CL18 has worse latency than even CL14 3200MHz. CL17 3733MHz is only 2ns better than that. Their highest recommended is 3600MHz CL16 because it&#039;s the cheapest option compared to B-die based CL14 3200MHz and CL17 3733MHz.

for a 65w chip stock? Nothing crazy. One fan in front, one in back. Even just low RPM stuff will be fine. I have pic related cooling a 53w tdp Pentium dual core and the fans barely hit 700RPM to keep it sub 35C.

up to you anon if you want to try it out. Numbers don&#039;t mean shit until you bench. If you can get CL17 3600MHz to play nice, give it a whirl.

yup sorry anon.
I wonder what the difference in performance would be with the Patriot Extreme Performance Viper 4 kit that was recommended in an earlier thread, where they use the timing:
br
CL17 - 17-19-19-39
br
Where as other name brands use the timing:
br
CL17 - 17-17-17-37
br
and yes it is given that the patriot kit is roughly half the price, but how big would the performance hit be.

a href="#p71713552" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71713552
/a

br
Very little, the other timings have an almost negligble impact on performance. What really always matters is clockspeed and CAS latency.

br
This is kind of blowing my mind, I always see these builds of people with mid-tier chips and safe overclocks stuffing their cases full of fans. I see a lot of builds use AIOs as intakes, is that shit just for aesthetics? 
br

br
Looking into this now, there are so many videos on youtube proving that case fans don&#039;t matter if air is constricted by the case anyway. 
br

br
So the best plan of action would be to add a brettygud aircooler? I could rig a way for the front to let in more air, but for a 65w chip I guess who cares? I&#039;d just be spending more money on fans. 
br

br
What BQ cooler is that? Pure rock? Do you think a low profile one like an L9i/a would work? I&#039;m not a fan of having to take off or work around very large air coolers.

2200g is actually a different chip. It has a single CCX while 1200 is 2+2.

a href="#p71713493" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71713493

br
It&#039;s 2ns every time the core needs something from memory, that&#039;s not in cache.
br
Though, not exactly true, due to speculative execution. This stuff gets fudged a lot. 
br

br
But games are the applications which are the most memory latency intensive because they are horribly poorly programmed and are accessing memory (or cache) repeatedly each frame, many times per second.
br

br
That&#039;s why going from 10ns to 8ns true memory latency (formula is in the OP), a 20% reduction, 2ns, can get you 10-20% increases in FPS.  Compare that to overclocking where going from 4GHz to 5GHz, a 20% increase, generally only gets you 1-5% gains in games because those extra clock cycles are just idle waiting on memory anyway. Hell, overclocking CPU can even make performance worse in games due to throttling.
br

br
see the 2933 CL14 vs CL16. That&#039;s a 1.35ns difference in latency, almost 15%, and the difference in 1% minimums is almost 10%.

Don&#039;t get 32GB of RAM unless you&#039;re absolutely sure you&#039;re need it. It&#039;ll run slower, especially if it&#039;s 4 SR sticks instead of 2 DR ones.
br
I use 32GB myself, but that&#039;s because I need it for work and can take the sacrifice in gaming speed.
br

br
Yes, B450 Tomahawk will be fine at least for 8 core and maybe 12 core Zen2.

Aesthetics and retardation, yes.

People THINK they&#039;re better, even though facts show otherwise. They are more expensive, louder, worse performing, and less reliable than air coolers.
br
It&#039;s the same way people think that Intel is better without bothering to look into the facts. Blindly buy aios, blindly buy intel, blindly buy a 970 evo for gaming, etc. Someone who actually does the research and understands the facts gets a better PC for half the cost.

any of the lower tiered nvmes, you pay a 1.5x premium for the samsung products, for which you get superior performance and longevity.

the superior performance isn&#039;t indicative in gaming, the loading times are often shortend by 1 second at most, which seem to be within the delta value. and longevity isn&#039;t really that important.

I like my 9600k for gaming
AMD is fucking garbage. Everything they make is absolutely, objectively crappy as shit and only a fat neckbeard would buy this shit-tier crappy shit because he&#039;s afraid of running out of autismbux (because God forbid he spend less money on Taco Bell and Mountain Dew.) I tried building an AMD gaming rig once and it was the worst experience of my life. First off, that CPU clip is fucking impossible to use. It looks just like an old Pentium CPU clip, but it&#039;s autistically retarded and I couldn&#039;t deal with it. And the graphics card was so fucking huge, I had to cut a hole all the way around my case to fit it in. Fucking AMD.
br

br
But wait, that&#039;s not even the best part! When I tried to start up my shitty autismbox (which I sold to the Association of Retarded Citizens BTW) the absolutely massive power draw dimmed every light in my house and throughout the entire neighborhood like I was firing up fucking ENIAC in the 1920s or some bullshit. I had plenty of time to worry about my power bill too, because this shitty thing couldn&#039;t figure out which of its 32 CPU cores to use and it took half a day to boot. As soon as I tried to play a game (fucking Starcraft from 1998), it lagged so hard it went backwards. I thought I should try downloading a driver, but there aren&#039;t any. There are no fucking drivers. What the shit, AMD? No wonder Apple doesn&#039;t use your shit. It wasn&#039;t long after that that I realized this thing was putting out more heat than a goddamn jet engine and it burned my house down.
br

br
Two weeks later, when I sold that piece of shit, I built an Intel/Nvidia rig! Holy shit, it&#039;s like jacking into the Matrix! I built it 5 years ago and it still runs every game in 4K at 240 FPS while using no power and it actually cools my house during the summer. What a beautiful machine, I seriously hope none of you are poor and stupid enough to buy AMD.

I still expect an OC&#039;d 9900k to barely edge out AMD, but I think the 3950x will be the point AMD takes the performance crown. But if the 3600 really comes close to a stock 9900 then AMD sort of wins by default. You&#039;d have to be insane to go with a $500 processor when a $200 one is almost just as good. Intel would have half the price on every processor at that point to stay competitive, but again we won&#039;t really know tell the 7th.

I know I need more than 16GB of RAM because I do enough rendering and video editing, the next logical step is 32GB. What&#039;s the ideal speed I should look for? I&#039;ll probably get one of those Zen2 CPUs soon.

Steel Legend, TUF gaming pro, and Tomahawk are good choices. Especially the later since you can flash the BIOS without a CPU but the former 2 also have their own good features.

You can spend 50% more and you&#039;ll only get a 10-15% performance increase. Not worth it.

do we know what ram to use with new ryzen 3000? will Corsair Vengeance LPX Black DDR4 3200MHz 2x8GB be a good buy? Theyre getting really cheap.

For some reason  I thought you said you wanted 1440p.
br
Wait for ryzen 3000 reviews in a few days. The 3600/X is probably going to be good for high refresh rate gaming.  You can find 2060 6Gb for $320 sometimes, just make sure it has a decent cooler.

br
That doesn&#039;t mean you HAVE to buy RAM validated to run at 3733 MHz; that&#039;s just a waste of money.
br

br
Get Micron E-Die (3000 Mhz CL15) or 3200 CL14 or CL16 and begin pumping voltage.

It is but if you&#039;re buying it for Ryzen 3000 series CPUs I&#039;d say give it a miss unless you already have a Ryzen processor. Can&#039;t update the BIOS to support 3000 series Ryzen without another CPU to temporarily put in it.

It came with no AM4 bracket, their EU support site is broken and the part I need wasn&#039;t available anywhere that ships here, so I had to return it.

I started by porting my low level C library to Rust. Those functions were unsafe since they did OS shit. Then I wrapped it up in a strongly typed interface. I tested extern &quot;C&quot; and it literally became a drop-in replacement for my C library. I barely learned the language and managed to reproduce months worth of C work on my library

the demand for *skilled* tech workers is huge, it&#039;s just not being met. the market is massively oversaturated with retards with degrees. i&#039;ve seen a job posting for a senior engine programmer position at bungie which listed &quot;experience with optimization&quot; under &quot;nice to haves&quot;. i mean jesus christ. ever think about how there were games on the 360/PS3 that ran at 60fps and looked good, and now it seems like the majority of console games are struggling to do the same on hardware with like 5 times the processing power and 16 times the memory? the industry is desperate for skilled workers, but they&#039;re not finding many thanks to the college bubble

char location[40];

br
which are instances of something (let&#039;s say a vote) so there can be multiple instances containing the same person but a different location where the vote came from. given the data is already loaded but i don&#039;t have access to it and i want to make a list of the candidates, what is the best way to do it? i thought about making an array matrix with [n][40] for n amount of candidates and going through it for every instance of the struct vector, checking if the names are equal to any already loaded in my array and loading it into a new place if not. But it seems inefficient, feels like if there&#039;s a lot of candidates and a lot of votes it would be slow as shit. I don&#039;t know any fancy libraries yet either, just the standard stuff and string. So what would be the best way to do this?

Why do you think it wouldn&#039;t work? Assuming your picture is correct, there are no circular dependencies. Imagine if instead of both the &quot;big function file class&quot; and &quot;main&quot; files importing from something you wrote, they imported something from the standard library, like os. If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;.
br

br
You need to watch out for circular dependencies in Python, though if your program even starts to run it probably means you don&#039;t have any.

I know. It&#039;s math. But if programming was like math we wouldn&#039;t have that argument. Point is that programming is very subjective and you use empirical results to show something is good.
Can someone help me understand this...
br

br
It seems to me that having variables defined outside the function scope is bad practice, unless you&#039;re using OOP.
br

br
Consider this in Java, which is completely acceptable because foo is an instance variable.
br

pre class="prettyprint"
class FooBar {
br
    int foo = 1
br
    public int fooBar(int bar) {
br
      return foo + bar;
br
    }
br
}
br

/pre

br
Now take the classless equivalent in Clojure (or JavaScript whatever).
br

pre class="prettyprint"
(def foo 1)
br
(defn foobar
br
    [bar]
br
    (+ foo bar))
br

/pre

br
It seems to me that foo should be defined in the function since they have no obvious relation other than being in the same file (whereas in OOP, they are related by class). This adds tight coupling...
br

br
However, this leads to a problem if foo is a variable shared by a bunch of other functions. So we&#039;re back to the problem of having a function tightly coupled with floating variables.

Isn&#039;t it wiser to just record min and max in two sorted arrays and then search for where the value belongs in those and associate each min with an index to use for an array containing the value?

br
I was hoping for some sort of clever hashing solution where you collapse the key input range 1-10 to 1 and then do a lookup using that.

I don&#039;t know if I should use threading here or remodel my network. I don&#039;t have the code with me so I will do my best to describe it
br

br
I have neural network that loads stuff from file and then does the session and initialize variables. This is in the same function as the whole network model is in (As they share variables).
br

br
Then I have another .py that uses tkinter to draw images which I then save using PIL and then they go into the network.
br

br
So because of the sess variable(I believe) I can only do 1 image and then I need to close and start the .py again
br

br
So I wonder if I should re model my network so it work on multiple images when I start it or use threading.
br
I am dummy dum please no bully
Our .net project work has some unit test that work on every machine and server, except mine. They all crash because they can&#039;t find a .dll that comes with Blend, which I installed with Visual Studio 2017.

I have about three years of a job free life left. I am a stay at home parent whos interested in learning about programming in depth. I used to live in the bay area california, but I am still very close by. If you were me would you go back to school to study programming to get a degree, or would you learn it on your own fully? Also, what areas of programming should I focus on based on where I live? I want to take advantage of my location as much as possible and make every day studying count, so i want to choose the right path.

New thread, new excitement from me that the numbers for my imported models vertex/normal elements seems to be correct. Converting from using a std::vector&lt;std::array&lt;float, 3&gt; &gt; to a std::vector&lt;glm::vec3&gt; made things much easier.

the demand for *skilled* tech workers is huge, it&#039;s just not being met. the market is massively oversaturated with retards with degrees. i&#039;ve seen a job posting for a senior engine programmer position at bungie which listed &quot;experience with optimization&quot; under &quot;nice to haves&quot;. i mean jesus christ. ever think about how there were games on the 360/PS3 that ran at 60fps and looked good, and now it seems like the majority of console games are struggling to do the same on hardware with like 5 times the processing power and 16 times the memory? the industry is desperate for skilled workers, but they&#039;re not finding many thanks to the college bubble

char location[40];

br
which are instances of something (let&#039;s say a vote) so there can be multiple instances containing the same person but a different location where the vote came from. given the data is already loaded but i don&#039;t have access to it and i want to make a list of the candidates, what is the best way to do it? i thought about making an array matrix with [n][40] for n amount of candidates and going through it for every instance of the struct vector, checking if the names are equal to any already loaded in my array and loading it into a new place if not. But it seems inefficient, feels like if there&#039;s a lot of candidates and a lot of votes it would be slow as shit. I don&#039;t know any fancy libraries yet either, just the standard stuff and string. So what would be the best way to do this?

Why do you think it wouldn&#039;t work? Assuming your picture is correct, there are no circular dependencies. Imagine if instead of both the &quot;big function file class&quot; and &quot;main&quot; files importing from something you wrote, they imported something from the standard library, like os. If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;.
br

br
You need to watch out for circular dependencies in Python, though if your program even starts to run it probably means you don&#039;t have any.

It seems to me that having variables defined outside the function scope is bad practice, unless you&#039;re using OOP.

    int foo = 1

    public int fooBar(int bar) {

br
Now take the classless equivalent in Clojure (or JavaScript whatever).
br

pre class="prettyprint"
(def foo 1)
br
(defn foobar
br
    [bar]
br
    (+ foo bar))
br

/pre

br
It seems to me that foo should be defined in the function since they have no obvious relation other than being in the same file (whereas in OOP, they are related by class). This adds tight coupling...
br

br
However, this leads to a problem if foo is a variable shared by a bunch of other functions. So we&#039;re back to the problem of having a function tightly coupled with floating variables.

So I would search the collection for a range containing my key and then extract the associated value?
br
Isn&#039;t it wiser to just record min and max in two sorted arrays and then search for where the value belongs in those and associate each min with an index to use for an array containing the value?
br

br
I was hoping for some sort of clever hashing solution where you collapse the key input range 1-10 to 1 and then do a lookup using that.
br

br
I have a lot of ranges to deal with.

You can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key, I dont quite understand your two sorted arrays idea, it doesn&#039;t sound like makes sense
br
if the ranges dont overlap then that&#039;s a further optimisation you can make on the search because min and max values can be used to search

br
I don&#039;t follow. When I do a lookup I will just have an integer. It might belong to one of the ranges in the set.
br
Are you saying that I should store the ranges somewhere and store the values separately using a map that uses the min and max as a key?

I&#039;m not all that concerned with the range-&gt;value step it&#039;s the key-&gt;range that I fear will take time.

Is that the full complexity of the problem? Obviously the example you gave can be solved with an if-else. Are there going to be lots of those ranges? Can new ranges be added? I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a hash function to do this

&quot;compiler&quot; is a pretty broad term that just means translating one programming language into another. but yeah because brainfuck is so simple, you get to skip many compilation stages and just directly translate each brainfuck command. the grammar is completely context-free. don&#039;t need syntax trees, state machines, regular expressions etc.

The word &quot;shall&quot; is used instead of will with the pronouns &quot;I&quot; (or &quot;we&quot;), for example
br

span class="quote"
&gt;I shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;We shall write code
/span

br

br
The following are wrong
br

span class="quote"
&gt;He shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;It shall write code
/span

br

br
But more importantly &quot;shall&quot;, in modern English, can simply be replaced with &quot;will&quot; on all occasions, otherwise you risk sounding pompous and archaic.
br

br
To improve readability, your sentence should actually not use &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;will&quot; but rather
br

br

span class="quote"
&gt;f returns a promise whose fulfilment indicates that the work is done.

I don&#039;t know if I should use threading here or remodel my network. I don&#039;t have the code with me so I will do my best to describe it
br

br
I have neural network that loads stuff from file and then does the session and initialize variables. This is in the same function as the whole network model is in (As they share variables).
br

br
Then I have another .py that uses tkinter to draw images which I then save using PIL and then they go into the network.
br

br
So because of the sess variable(I believe) I can only do 1 image and then I need to close and start the .py again
br

br
So I wonder if I should re model my network so it work on multiple images when I start it or use threading.

I have about three years of a job free life left. I am a stay at home parent whos interested in learning about programming in depth. I used to live in the bay area california, but I am still very close by. If you were me would you go back to school to study programming to get a degree, or would you learn it on your own fully? Also, what areas of programming should I focus on based on where I live? I want to take advantage of my location as much as possible and make every day studying count, so i want to choose the right path.

New thread, new excitement from me that the numbers for my imported models vertex/normal elements seems to be correct. Converting from using a std::vector&lt;std::array&lt;float, 3&gt; &gt; to a std::vector&lt;glm::vec3&gt; made things much easier.

I started by porting my low level C library to Rust. Those functions were unsafe since they did OS shit. Then I wrapped it up in a strongly typed interface.

so in c, i have an array of structures with say

struct stuff{

char name[40];
br
char sex;
br
char location[40];
br
}

br

br
which are instances of something (let&#039;s say a vote) so there can be multiple instances containing the same person but a different location where the vote came from. given the data is already loaded but i don&#039;t have access to it and i want to make a list of the candidates, what is the best way to do it? i thought about making an array matrix with [n][40] for n amount of candidates and going through it for every instance of the struct vector, checking if the names are equal to any already loaded in my array and loading it into a new place if not. But it seems inefficient, feels like if there&#039;s a lot of candidates and a lot of votes it would be slow as shit. I don&#039;t know any fancy libraries yet either, just the standard stuff and string. So what would be the best way to do this?

Why do you think it wouldn&#039;t work? Assuming your picture is correct, there are no circular dependencies. Imagine if instead of both the &quot;big function file class&quot; and &quot;main&quot; files importing from something you wrote, they imported something from the standard library, like os. If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;.
br

br
You need to watch out for circular dependencies in Python, though if your program even starts to run it probably means you don&#039;t have any.

I know. It&#039;s math. But if programming was like math we wouldn&#039;t have that argument. Point is that programming is very subjective and you use empirical results to show something is good.
Can someone help me understand this...
br

br
It seems to me that having variables defined outside the function scope is bad practice, unless you&#039;re using OOP.
br

br
Consider this in Java, which is completely acceptable because foo is an instance variable.
br

pre class="prettyprint"
class FooBar {
br
    int foo = 1
br
    public int fooBar(int bar) {
br
      return foo + bar;
br
    }
br
}
br

/pre

br
Now take the classless equivalent in Clojure (or JavaScript whatever).
br

pre class="prettyprint"
(def foo 1)
br
(defn foobar
br
    [bar]
br
    (+ foo bar))
br

/pre

br
It seems to me that foo should be defined in the function since they have no obvious relation other than being in the same file (whereas in OOP, they are related by class). This adds tight coupling...
br

br
However, this leads to a problem if foo is a variable shared by a bunch of other functions. So we&#039;re back to the problem of having a function tightly coupled with floating variables.

br
Why datastructure should I use for this? An associative array would have a lot of entries and that doesn&#039;t make much sense.
br
Is there a range based associative array?
are recursive-descent parsers the industry&#039;s standard?

br
a collection of ranges

a href="#p71717367" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71717367
/a

br
So I would search the collection for a range containing my key and then extract the associated value?
br
Isn&#039;t it wiser to just record min and max in two sorted arrays and then search for where the value belongs in those and associate each min with an index to use for an array containing the value?
br

br
I was hoping for some sort of clever hashing solution where you collapse the key input range 1-10 to 1 and then do a lookup using that.
br

br
I have a lot of ranges to deal with.

a href="#p71717407" class="quotelink"

br
You can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key, I dont quite understand your two sorted arrays idea, it doesn&#039;t sound like makes sense
br
if the ranges dont overlap then that&#039;s a further optimisation you can make on the search because min and max values can be used to search

No the ranges shouldn&#039;t overlap. I don&#039;t want two values returned from a lookup.
br

span class="quote"
&gt;you can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key
/span

br
I don&#039;t follow. When I do a lookup I will just have an integer. It might belong to one of the ranges in the set.
br
Are you saying that I should store the ranges somewhere and store the values separately using a map that uses the min and max as a key?
br
I&#039;m not all that concerned with the range-&gt;value step it&#039;s the key-&gt;range that I fear will take time.

Is that the full complexity of the problem? Obviously the example you gave can be solved with an if-else. Are there going to be lots of those ranges? Can new ranges be added? I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a hash function to do this

Well if you were writing a compiler for a more complex language there&#039;s all sort of additional stuff to do like optimisation.

&gt;&gt;71717760

br
&quot;compiler&quot; is a pretty broad term that just means translating one programming language into another. but yeah because brainfuck is so simple, you get to skip many compilation stages and just directly translate each brainfuck command. the grammar is completely context-free. don&#039;t need syntax trees, state machines, regular expressions etc.

Question for native English speakers:
br

br

span class="quote"
&gt;f shall return a promise whose fulfilment indicates that the work is done.
/span

br

br
Is this grammatically correct English? How can the sentence be improved for readability?
People actually read dpt.txt?
br
For what purpose?

a href="#p71717884" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71717884

br
Sounds fine to me

a href="#p71717884" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71717884
/a

br
The word &quot;shall&quot; is used instead of will with the pronouns &quot;I&quot; (or &quot;we&quot;), for example
br

span class="quote"
&gt;I shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;We shall write code
/span

br

br
The following are wrong
br

span class="quote"
&gt;He shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;It shall write code
/span

br

br
But more importantly &quot;shall&quot;, in modern English, can simply be replaced with &quot;will&quot; on all occasions, otherwise you risk sounding pompous and archaic.
br

br
To improve readability, your sentence should actually not use &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;will&quot; but rather
br

br

span class="quote"
&gt;f returns a promise whose fulfilment indicates that the work is done.

I&#039;m telling you the technical usage for &quot;shall&quot; just as an aside, the main message is that &quot;shall&quot; shouldn&#039;t really be used at all except for stylistic effect (e.g. emulating some archaic vernacular).

I don&#039;t know if I should use threading here or remodel my network. I don&#039;t have the code with me so I will do my best to describe it
br

br
I have neural network that loads stuff from file and then does the session and initialize variables. This is in the same function as the whole network model is in (As they share variables).
br

br
Then I have another .py that uses tkinter to draw images which I then save using PIL and then they go into the network.
br

br
So because of the sess variable(I believe) I can only do 1 image and then I need to close and start the .py again
br

br
So I wonder if I should re model my network so it work on multiple images when I start it or use threading.

I used to live in the bay area california, but I am still very close by. If you were me would you go back to school to study programming to get a degree, or would you learn it on your own fully? Also, what areas of programming should I focus on based on where I live? I want to take advantage of my location as much as possible and make every day studying count, so i want to choose the right path.

A degree is useless if you don&#039;t work.
br

br
Learn by yourself.

I want to eventually start working. Forgot to mention that. So should I go for a degree? I am just worried about bullshit classes getting in the way of actually learning programming.

br
There are going to be bullshit classes that have nothing to do with programming and is going to hinder your progress.
br

br
Programming classes will force you to do certain things just because.
br

br
If you learn programming by yourself you can learn so much more in depth without having a teacher telling you &quot;YOU CANT DO THAT!&quot;

New thread, new excitement from me that the numbers for my imported models vertex/normal elements seems to be correct. Converting from using a std::vector&lt;std::array&lt;float, 3&gt; &gt; to a std::vector&lt;glm::vec3&gt; made things much easier. Also converting the data structure I use for holding 3 vertices now uses an array instead of 3 separate members called vertex1, vertex2, vertex3. Woot!

br
I started by porting my low level C library to Rust. Those functions were unsafe since they did OS shit. Then I wrapped it up in a strongly typed interface. I tested extern &quot;C&quot; and it literally became a drop-in replacement for my C library. I barely learned the language and managed to reproduce months worth of C work on my library

the demand for *skilled* tech workers is huge, it&#039;s just not being met. the market is massively oversaturated with retards with degrees. i&#039;ve seen a job posting for a senior engine programmer position at bungie which listed &quot;experience with optimization&quot; under &quot;nice to haves&quot;. i mean jesus christ. ever think about how there were games on the 360/PS3 that ran at 60fps and looked good, and now it seems like the majority of console games are struggling to do the same on hardware with like 5 times the processing power and 16 times the memory? the industry is desperate for skilled workers, but they&#039;re not finding many thanks to the college bubble

so in c, i have an array of structures with say
br

pre class="prettyprint"
struct stuff{
br
char name[40];
br
char sex;
br
char location[40];
br
}
/pre

br

br
which are instances of something (let&#039;s say a vote) so there can be multiple instances containing the same person but a different location where the vote came from. given the data is already loaded but i don&#039;t have access to it and i want to make a list of the candidates, what is the best way to do it? i thought about making an array matrix with [n][40] for n amount of candidates and going through it for every instance of the struct vector, checking if the names are equal to any already loaded in my array and loading it into a new place if not. But it seems inefficient, feels like if there&#039;s a lot of candidates and a lot of votes it would be slow as shit. I don&#039;t know any fancy libraries yet either, just the standard stuff and string. So what would be the best way to do this?

Why do you think it wouldn&#039;t work? Assuming your picture is correct, there are no circular dependencies. Imagine if instead of both the &quot;big function file class&quot; and &quot;main&quot; files importing from something you wrote, they imported something from the standard library, like os. If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;.
br

br
You need to watch out for circular dependencies in Python, though if your program even starts to run it probably means you don&#039;t have any.

I know. It&#039;s math. But if programming was like math we wouldn&#039;t have that argument. Point is that programming is very subjective and you use empirical results to show something is good.
Can someone help me understand this...
br

br
It seems to me that having variables defined outside the function scope is bad practice, unless you&#039;re using OOP.
br

br
Consider this in Java, which is completely acceptable because foo is an instance variable.
br

pre class="prettyprint"
class FooBar {
br
    int foo = 1
br
    public int fooBar(int bar) {
br
      return foo + bar;
br
    }
br
}
br

/pre

br
Now take the classless equivalent in Clojure (or JavaScript whatever).
br

pre class="prettyprint"
(def foo 1)
br
(defn foobar
br
    [bar]
br
    (+ foo bar))
br

/pre

br
It seems to me that foo should be defined in the function since they have no obvious relation other than being in the same file (whereas in OOP, they are related by class). This adds tight coupling...
br

br
However, this leads to a problem if foo is a variable shared by a bunch of other functions. So we&#039;re back to the problem of having a function tightly coupled with floating variables.

br
You can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key, I dont quite understand your two sorted arrays idea, it doesn&#039;t sound like makes sense
br
if the ranges dont overlap then that&#039;s a further optimisation you can make on the search because min and max values can be used to search

No the ranges shouldn&#039;t overlap. I don&#039;t want two values returned from a lookup.
br

span class="quote"
&gt;you can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key
/span

br
I don&#039;t follow. When I do a lookup I will just have an integer. It might belong to one of the ranges in the set.
br
Are you saying that I should store the ranges somewhere and store the values separately using a map that uses the min and max as a key?
br
I&#039;m not all that concerned with the range-&gt;value step it&#039;s the key-&gt;range that I fear will take time.

Is that the full complexity of the problem? Obviously the example you gave can be solved with an if-else. Are there going to be lots of those ranges? Can new ranges be added? I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a hash function to do this

Well if you were writing a compiler for a more complex language there&#039;s all sort of additional stuff to do like optimisation.

br
&quot;compiler&quot; is a pretty broad term that just means translating one programming language into another. but yeah because brainfuck is so simple, you get to skip many compilation stages and just directly translate each brainfuck command. the grammar is completely context-free. don&#039;t need syntax trees, state machines, regular expressions etc.

Question for native English speakers:
br

br

span class="quote"
&gt;f shall return a promise whose fulfilment indicates that the work is done.
/span

br

br
Is this grammatically correct English? How can the sentence be improved for readability?
People actually read dpt.txt?
br
For what purpose?

a href="#p71717884" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71717884

br
Sounds fine to me

a href="#p71717884" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71717884
/a

br
The word &quot;shall&quot; is used instead of will with the pronouns &quot;I&quot; (or &quot;we&quot;), for example
br

span class="quote"
&gt;I shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;We shall write code
/span

br

br
The following are wrong
br

span class="quote"
&gt;He shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;It shall write code
/span

br

br
But more importantly &quot;shall&quot;, in modern English, can simply be replaced with &quot;will&quot; on all occasions, otherwise you risk sounding pompous and archaic.
br

br
To improve readability, your sentence should actually not use &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;will&quot; but rather
br

br

span class="quote"
&gt;f returns a promise whose fulfilment indicates that the work is done.

I&#039;m telling you the technical usage for &quot;shall&quot; just as an aside, the main message is that &quot;shall&quot; shouldn&#039;t really be used at all except for stylistic effect (e.g. emulating some archaic vernacular).

I don&#039;t know if I should use threading here or remodel my network. I don&#039;t have the code with me so I will do my best to describe it
br

br
I have neural network that loads stuff from file and then does the session and initialize variables. This is in the same function as the whole network model is in (As they share variables).
br

br
Then I have another .py that uses tkinter to draw images which I then save using PIL and then they go into the network.
br

br
So because of the sess variable(I believe) I can only do 1 image and then I need to close and start the .py again
br

br
So I wonder if I should re model my network so it work on multiple images when I start it or use threading.

I started by porting my low level C library to Rust. Those functions were unsafe since they did OS shit. Then I wrapped it up in a strongly typed interface.

which are instances of something (let&#039;s say a vote) so there can be multiple instances containing the same person but a different location where the vote came from. given the data is already loaded but i don&#039;t have access to it and i want to make a list of the candidates, what is the best way to do it? i thought about making an array matrix with [n][40] for n amount of candidates and going through it for every instance of the struct vector, checking if the names are equal to any already loaded in my array and loading it into a new place if not. But it seems inefficient, feels like if there&#039;s a lot of candidates and a lot of votes it would be slow as shit. I don&#039;t know any fancy libraries yet either, just the standard stuff and string. So what would be the best way to do this?

Why do you think it wouldn&#039;t work? Assuming your picture is correct, there are no circular dependencies. Imagine if instead of both the &quot;big function file class&quot; and &quot;main&quot; files importing from something you wrote, they imported something from the standard library, like os. If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;.
br

br
You need to watch out for circular dependencies in Python, though if your program even starts to run it probably means you don&#039;t have any.

I know. It&#039;s math. But if programming was like math we wouldn&#039;t have that argument. Point is that programming is very subjective and you use empirical results to show something is good.
Can someone help me understand this...
br

br
It seems to me that having variables defined outside the function scope is bad practice, unless you&#039;re using OOP.
br

br
Consider this in Java, which is completely acceptable because foo is an instance variable.
br

pre class="prettyprint"
class FooBar {
br
    int foo = 1
br
    public int fooBar(int bar) {
br
      return foo + bar;
br
    }
br
}
br

/pre

br
Now take the classless equivalent in Clojure (or JavaScript whatever).
br

pre class="prettyprint"
(def foo 1)
br
(defn foobar
br
    [bar]
br
    (+ foo bar))
br

/pre

br
It seems to me that foo should be defined in the function since they have no obvious relation other than being in the same file (whereas in OOP, they are related by class). This adds tight coupling...
br

br
However, this leads to a problem if foo is a variable shared by a bunch of other functions. So we&#039;re back to the problem of having a function tightly coupled with floating variables.

I was hoping for some sort of clever hashing solution where you collapse the key input range 1-10 to 1 and then do a lookup using that.

I don&#039;t follow. When I do a lookup I will just have an integer. It might belong to one of the ranges in the set.

br
The word &quot;shall&quot; is used instead of will with the pronouns &quot;I&quot; (or &quot;we&quot;), for example
br

span class="quote"
&gt;I shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;We shall write code
/span

br

br
The following are wrong
br

span class="quote"
&gt;He shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;It shall write code
/span

br

br
But more importantly &quot;shall&quot;, in modern English, can simply be replaced with &quot;will&quot; on all occasions, otherwise you risk sounding pompous and archaic.
br

br
To improve readability, your sentence should actually not use &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;will&quot; but rather
br

br

span class="quote"
&gt;f returns a promise whose fulfilment indicates that the work is done.

I&#039;m telling you the technical usage for &quot;shall&quot; just as an aside, the main message is that &quot;shall&quot; shouldn&#039;t really be used at all except for stylistic effect (e.g. emulating some archaic vernacular).

I don&#039;t know if I should use threading here or remodel my network. I don&#039;t have the code with me so I will do my best to describe it
br

br
I have neural network that loads stuff from file and then does the session and initialize variables. This is in the same function as the whole network model is in (As they share variables).
br

br
Then I have another .py that uses tkinter to draw images which I then save using PIL and then they go into the network.
br

br
So because of the sess variable(I believe) I can only do 1 image and then I need to close and start the .py again
br

br
So I wonder if I should re model my network so it work on multiple images when I start it or use threading.
br
I am dummy dum please no bully
Our .net project work has some unit test that work on every machine and server, except mine. They all crash because they can&#039;t find a .dll that comes with Blend, which I installed with Visual Studio 2017.

I have about three years of a job free life left. I am a stay at home parent whos interested in learning about programming in depth. I used to live in the bay area california, but I am still very close by. If you were me would you go back to school to study programming to get a degree, or would you learn it on your own fully? Also, what areas of programming should I focus on based on where I live? I want to take advantage of my location as much as possible and make every day studying count, so i want to choose the right path.

the demand for *skilled* tech workers is huge, it&#039;s just not being met. the market is massively oversaturated with retards with degrees. i&#039;ve seen a job posting for a senior engine programmer position at bungie which listed &quot;experience with optimization&quot; under &quot;nice to haves&quot;. i mean jesus christ. ever think about how there were games on the 360/PS3 that ran at 60fps and looked good, and now it seems like the majority of console games are struggling to do the same on hardware with like 5 times the processing power and 16 times the memory? the industry is desperate for skilled workers, but they&#039;re not finding many thanks to the college bubble

so in c, i have an array of structures with say

struct stuff{

char name[40];
br
char sex;
br
char location[40];
br
}
/pre

br

br
which are instances of something (let&#039;s say a vote) so there can be multiple instances containing the same person but a different location where the vote came from. given the data is already loaded but i don&#039;t have access to it and i want to make a list of the candidates, what is the best way to do it? i thought about making an array matrix with [n][40] for n amount of candidates and going through it for every instance of the struct vector, checking if the names are equal to any already loaded in my array and loading it into a new place if not. But it seems inefficient, feels like if there&#039;s a lot of candidates and a lot of votes it would be slow as shit. I don&#039;t know any fancy libraries yet either, just the standard stuff and string. So what would be the best way to do this?

Why do you think it wouldn&#039;t work? Assuming your picture is correct, there are no circular dependencies. Imagine if instead of both the &quot;big function file class&quot; and &quot;main&quot; files importing from something you wrote, they imported something from the standard library, like os. If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;.
br

br
You need to watch out for circular dependencies in Python, though if your program even starts to run it probably means you don&#039;t have any.

i actually was going for circular import thing, because all my functions were in main file, but it was not working, so i decided to separate all functions to a different file, but the thing you wrote &quot;If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;&quot; was the exact thing i wanted to confirm

I know. It&#039;s math. But if programming was like math we wouldn&#039;t have that argument. Point is that programming is very subjective and you use empirical results to show something is good.
Can someone help me understand this...
br

br
It seems to me that having variables defined outside the function scope is bad practice, unless you&#039;re using OOP.
br

br
Consider this in Java, which is completely acceptable because foo is an instance variable.
br

pre class="prettyprint"
class FooBar {
br
    int foo = 1
br
    public int fooBar(int bar) {
br
      return foo + bar;
br
    }
br
}
br

/pre

br
Now take the classless equivalent in Clojure (or JavaScript whatever).
br

pre class="prettyprint"
(def foo 1)
br
(defn foobar
br
    [bar]
br
    (+ foo bar))
br

/pre

br
It seems to me that foo should be defined in the function since they have no obvious relation other than being in the same file (whereas in OOP, they are related by class). This adds tight coupling...
br

br
However, this leads to a problem if foo is a variable shared by a bunch of other functions. So we&#039;re back to the problem of having a function tightly coupled with floating variables.

Are programmers more left leaning or right leaning, politically? I&#039;ve seen a pretty strong split. Like half are liberal SJW beta types, while the other half into Trump and the alt-right.

Pretty sure there&#039;s nothing inherent to programming that makes programmers left/right aligned.

br
So I would search the collection for a range containing my key and then extract the associated value?
br
Isn&#039;t it wiser to just record min and max in two sorted arrays and then search for where the value belongs in those and associate each min with an index to use for an array containing the value?
br

br
I was hoping for some sort of clever hashing solution where you collapse the key input range 1-10 to 1 and then do a lookup using that.
br

br
I have a lot of ranges to deal with.

You can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key, I dont quite understand your two sorted arrays idea, it doesn&#039;t sound like makes sense
br
if the ranges dont overlap then that&#039;s a further optimisation you can make on the search because min and max values can be used to search

&gt;you can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key
/span

br
I don&#039;t follow. When I do a lookup I will just have an integer. It might belong to one of the ranges in the set.
br
Are you saying that I should store the ranges somewhere and store the values separately using a map that uses the min and max as a key?

I&#039;m not all that concerned with the range-&gt;value step it&#039;s the key-&gt;range that I fear will take time.

Is that the full complexity of the problem? Obviously the example you gave can be solved with an if-else. Are there going to be lots of those ranges? Can new ranges be added? I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a hash function to do this

&quot;compiler&quot; is a pretty broad term that just means translating one programming language into another. but yeah because brainfuck is so simple, you get to skip many compilation stages and just directly translate each brainfuck command. the grammar is completely context-free. don&#039;t need syntax trees, state machines, regular expressions etc.

span class="quote"

br

br
The following are wrong
br

span class="quote"
&gt;He shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;It shall write code
/span

br

br
But more importantly &quot;shall&quot;, in modern English, can simply be replaced with &quot;will&quot; on all occasions, otherwise you risk sounding pompous and archaic.

To improve readability, your sentence should actually not use &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;will&quot; but rather

I don&#039;t know if I should use threading here or remodel my network. I don&#039;t have the code with me so I will do my best to describe it
br

br
I have neural network that loads stuff from file and then does the session and initialize variables. This is in the same function as the whole network model is in (As they share variables).
br

br
Then I have another .py that uses tkinter to draw images which I then save using PIL and then they go into the network.
br

br
So because of the sess variable(I believe) I can only do 1 image and then I need to close and start the .py again
br

br
So I wonder if I should re model my network so it work on multiple images when I start it or use threading.
br
I am dummy dum please no bully
Our .net project work has some unit test that work on every machine and server, except mine. They all crash because they can&#039;t find a .dll that comes with Blend, which I installed with Visual Studio 2017. The file is physically in the right directories, how can I tell VC to use it, without editing the project? (Since it works everywhere my PC is clearly at fault)

I have about three years of a job free life left. I am a stay at home parent whos interested in learning about programming in depth. I used to live in the bay area california, but I am still very close by. If you were me would you go back to school to study programming to get a degree, or would you learn it on your own fully? Also, what areas of programming should I focus on based on where I live? I want to take advantage of my location as much as possible and make every day studying count, so i want to choose the right path.

New thread, new excitement from me that the numbers for my imported models vertex/normal elements seems to be correct. Converting from using a std::vector&lt;std::array&lt;float, 3&gt; &gt; to a std::vector&lt;glm::vec3&gt; made things much easier.

&gt;market demand for skilled tech workers is through the roof

br
the demand for *skilled* tech workers is huge, it&#039;s just not being met. the market is massively oversaturated with retards with degrees. i&#039;ve seen a job posting for a senior engine programmer position at bungie which listed &quot;experience with optimization&quot; under &quot;nice to haves&quot;. i mean jesus christ. ever think about how there were games on the 360/PS3 that ran at 60fps and looked good, and now it seems like the majority of console games are struggling to do the same on hardware with like 5 times the processing power and 16 times the memory? the industry is desperate for skilled workers, but they&#039;re not finding many thanks to the college bubble

so in c, i have an array of structures with say

struct stuff{

char name[40];

char sex;
br
char location[40];

}

br

br
which are instances of something (let&#039;s say a vote) so there can be multiple instances containing the same person but a different location where the vote came from. given the data is already loaded but i don&#039;t have access to it and i want to make a list of the candidates, what is the best way to do it? i thought about making an array matrix with [n][40] for n amount of candidates and going through it for every instance of the struct vector, checking if the names are equal to any already loaded in my array and loading it into a new place if not. But it seems inefficient, feels like if there&#039;s a lot of candidates and a lot of votes it would be slow as shit. I don&#039;t know any fancy libraries yet either, just the standard stuff and string. So what would be the best way to do this?

Why do you think it wouldn&#039;t work? Assuming your picture is correct, there are no circular dependencies. Imagine if instead of both the &quot;big function file class&quot; and &quot;main&quot; files importing from something you wrote, they imported something from the standard library, like os. If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;.
br

br
You need to watch out for circular dependencies in Python, though if your program even starts to run it probably means you don&#039;t have any.

I know. It&#039;s math. But if programming was like math we wouldn&#039;t have that argument. Point is that programming is very subjective and you use empirical results to show something is good.
Can someone help me understand this...
br

br
It seems to me that having variables defined outside the function scope is bad practice, unless you&#039;re using OOP.
br

br
Consider this in Java, which is completely acceptable because foo is an instance variable.
br

pre class="prettyprint"
class FooBar {
br
    int foo = 1
br
    public int fooBar(int bar) {
br
      return foo + bar;
br
    }
br
}
br

/pre

br
Now take the classless equivalent in Clojure (or JavaScript whatever).
br

pre class="prettyprint"
(def foo 1)
br
(defn foobar
br
    [bar]
br
    (+ foo bar))
br

/pre

br
It seems to me that foo should be defined in the function since they have no obvious relation other than being in the same file (whereas in OOP, they are related by class). This adds tight coupling...
br

br
However, this leads to a problem if foo is a variable shared by a bunch of other functions. So we&#039;re back to the problem of having a function tightly coupled with floating variables.

a href="#p71717367" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71717367

br
So I would search the collection for a range containing my key and then extract the associated value?
br
Isn&#039;t it wiser to just record min and max in two sorted arrays and then search for where the value belongs in those and associate each min with an index to use for an array containing the value?
br

br
I was hoping for some sort of clever hashing solution where you collapse the key input range 1-10 to 1 and then do a lookup using that.
br

br
I have a lot of ranges to deal with.

You can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key, I dont quite understand your two sorted arrays idea, it doesn&#039;t sound like makes sense
br
if the ranges dont overlap then that&#039;s a further optimisation you can make on the search because min and max values can be used to search

&gt;you can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key
/span

br
I don&#039;t follow. When I do a lookup I will just have an integer. It might belong to one of the ranges in the set.
br
Are you saying that I should store the ranges somewhere and store the values separately using a map that uses the min and max as a key?
br
I&#039;m not all that concerned with the range-&gt;value step it&#039;s the key-&gt;range that I fear will take time.

Is that the full complexity of the problem? Obviously the example you gave can be solved with an if-else. Are there going to be lots of those ranges? Can new ranges be added? I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a hash function to do this

&quot;compiler&quot; is a pretty broad term that just means translating one programming language into another. but yeah because brainfuck is so simple, you get to skip many compilation stages and just directly translate each brainfuck command. the grammar is completely context-free. don&#039;t need syntax trees, state machines, regular expressions etc.

Question for native English speakers:

br
The word &quot;shall&quot; is used instead of will with the pronouns &quot;I&quot; (or &quot;we&quot;), for example
br

span class="quote"
&gt;I shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;We shall write code
/span

br

br
The following are wrong
br

span class="quote"
&gt;He shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;It shall write code
/span

br

br
But more importantly &quot;shall&quot;, in modern English, can simply be replaced with &quot;will&quot; on all occasions, otherwise you risk sounding pompous and archaic.
br

br
To improve readability, your sentence should actually not use &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;will&quot; but rather
br

br

span class="quote"
&gt;f returns a promise whose fulfilment indicates that the work is done.

I&#039;m telling you the technical usage for &quot;shall&quot; just as an aside, the main message is that &quot;shall&quot; shouldn&#039;t really be used at all except for stylistic effect (e.g. emulating some archaic vernacular).

I don&#039;t know if I should use threading here or remodel my network. I don&#039;t have the code with me so I will do my best to describe it
br

br
I have neural network that loads stuff from file and then does the session and initialize variables. This is in the same function as the whole network model is in (As they share variables).
br

br
Then I have another .py that uses tkinter to draw images which I then save using PIL and then they go into the network.
br

br
So because of the sess variable(I believe) I can only do 1 image and then I need to close and start the .py again
br

br
So I wonder if I should re model my network so it work on multiple images when I start it or use threading.

I have about three years of a job free life left. I am a stay at home parent whos interested in learning about programming in depth. I used to live in the bay area california, but I am still very close by. If you were me would you go back to school to study programming to get a degree, or would you learn it on your own fully? Also, what areas of programming should I focus on based on where I live? I want to take advantage of my location as much as possible and make every day studying count, so i want to choose the right path.

Programming classes will force you to do certain things just because.

New thread, new excitement from me that the numbers for my imported models vertex/normal elements seems to be correct. Converting from using a std::vector&lt;std::array&lt;float, 3&gt; &gt; to a std::vector&lt;glm::vec3&gt; made things much easier.

I started by porting my low level C library to Rust. Those functions were unsafe since they did OS shit. Then I wrapped it up in a strongly typed interface.

so in c, i have an array of structures with say
br

pre class="prettyprint"
struct stuff{
br
char name[40];
br
char sex;
br
char location[40];
br
}
/pre

br

br
which are instances of something (let&#039;s say a vote) so there can be multiple instances containing the same person but a different location where the vote came from. given the data is already loaded but i don&#039;t have access to it and i want to make a list of the candidates, what is the best way to do it? i thought about making an array matrix with [n][40] for n amount of candidates and going through it for every instance of the struct vector, checking if the names are equal to any already loaded in my array and loading it into a new place if not. But it seems inefficient, feels like if there&#039;s a lot of candidates and a lot of votes it would be slow as shit. I don&#039;t know any fancy libraries yet either, just the standard stuff and string. So what would be the best way to do this?

Why do you think it wouldn&#039;t work? Assuming your picture is correct, there are no circular dependencies. Imagine if instead of both the &quot;big function file class&quot; and &quot;main&quot; files importing from something you wrote, they imported something from the standard library, like os. If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;.
br

br
You need to watch out for circular dependencies in Python, though if your program even starts to run it probably means you don&#039;t have any.

This doesn&#039;t make sense to me. Syntax should be one of the first things you settle on. Why would he change the syntax after already writing an entire project with it? I seriously doubt he&#039;s going to change it, it just looks like another symbol-hell of a language like C++

I know. It&#039;s math. But if programming was like math we wouldn&#039;t have that argument. Point is that programming is very subjective and you use empirical results to show something is good.
Can someone help me understand this...
br

br
It seems to me that having variables defined outside the function scope is bad practice, unless you&#039;re using OOP.
br

br
Consider this in Java, which is completely acceptable because foo is an instance variable.
br

pre class="prettyprint"
class FooBar {
br
    int foo = 1
br
    public int fooBar(int bar) {
br
      return foo + bar;
br
    }
br
}
br

/pre

br
Now take the classless equivalent in Clojure (or JavaScript whatever).
br

pre class="prettyprint"
(def foo 1)
br
(defn foobar
br
    [bar]
br
    (+ foo bar))
br

/pre

br
It seems to me that foo should be defined in the function since they have no obvious relation other than being in the same file (whereas in OOP, they are related by class). This adds tight coupling...
br

br
However, this leads to a problem if foo is a variable shared by a bunch of other functions. So we&#039;re back to the problem of having a function tightly coupled with floating variables.

br
Why datastructure should I use for this? An associative array would have a lot of entries and that doesn&#039;t make much sense.
br
Is there a range based associative array?
are recursive-descent parsers the industry&#039;s standard?

br
a collection of ranges

a href="#p71717367" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71717367
/a

br
So I would search the collection for a range containing my key and then extract the associated value?
br
Isn&#039;t it wiser to just record min and max in two sorted arrays and then search for where the value belongs in those and associate each min with an index to use for an array containing the value?
br

br
I was hoping for some sort of clever hashing solution where you collapse the key input range 1-10 to 1 and then do a lookup using that.
br

br
I have a lot of ranges to deal with.

br
You can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key, I dont quite understand your two sorted arrays idea, it doesn&#039;t sound like makes sense
br
if the ranges dont overlap then that&#039;s a further optimisation you can make on the search because min and max values can be used to search

&gt;you can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key
/span

br
I don&#039;t follow. When I do a lookup I will just have an integer. It might belong to one of the ranges in the set.
br
Are you saying that I should store the ranges somewhere and store the values separately using a map that uses the min and max as a key?
br
I&#039;m not all that concerned with the range-&gt;value step it&#039;s the key-&gt;range that I fear will take time.

Is that the full complexity of the problem? Obviously the example you gave can be solved with an if-else. Are there going to be lots of those ranges? Can new ranges be added? I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a hash function to do this

br
&quot;compiler&quot; is a pretty broad term that just means translating one programming language into another. but yeah because brainfuck is so simple, you get to skip many compilation stages and just directly translate each brainfuck command. the grammar is completely context-free. don&#039;t need syntax trees, state machines, regular expressions etc.

Question for native English speakers:

br

br
Is this grammatically correct English? How can the sentence be improved for readability?

br
The word &quot;shall&quot; is used instead of will with the pronouns &quot;I&quot; (or &quot;we&quot;), for example
br

span class="quote"
&gt;I shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;We shall write code
/span

br

br
The following are wrong
br

span class="quote"
&gt;He shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;It shall write code
/span

br

br
But more importantly &quot;shall&quot;, in modern English, can simply be replaced with &quot;will&quot; on all occasions, otherwise you risk sounding pompous and archaic.
br

br
To improve readability, your sentence should actually not use &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;will&quot; but rather
br

br

span class="quote"
&gt;f returns a promise whose fulfilment indicates that the work is done.

I don&#039;t know if I should use threading here or remodel my network. I don&#039;t have the code with me so I will do my best to describe it
br

br
I have neural network that loads stuff from file and then does the session and initialize variables. This is in the same function as the whole network model is in (As they share variables).
br

br
Then I have another .py that uses tkinter to draw images which I then save using PIL and then they go into the network.
br

br
So because of the sess variable(I believe) I can only do 1 image and then I need to close and start the .py again
br

br
So I wonder if I should re model my network so it work on multiple images when I start it or use threading.

New thread, new excitement from me that the numbers for my imported models vertex/normal elements seems to be correct. Converting from using a std::vector&lt;std::array&lt;float, 3&gt; &gt; to a std::vector&lt;glm::vec3&gt; made things much easier. Also converting the data structure I use for holding 3 vertices now uses an array instead of 3 separate members called vertex1, vertex2, vertex3. Woot!

I started by porting my low level C library to Rust. Those functions were unsafe since they did OS shit. Then I wrapped it up in a strongly typed interface.

the demand for *skilled* tech workers is huge, it&#039;s just not being met. the market is massively oversaturated with retards with degrees. i&#039;ve seen a job posting for a senior engine programmer position at bungie which listed &quot;experience with optimization&quot; under &quot;nice to haves&quot;. i mean jesus christ. ever think about how there were games on the 360/PS3 that ran at 60fps and looked good, and now it seems like the majority of console games are struggling to do the same on hardware with like 5 times the processing power and 16 times the memory? the industry is desperate for skilled workers, but they&#039;re not finding many thanks to the college bubble

br
which are instances of something (let&#039;s say a vote) so there can be multiple instances containing the same person but a different location where the vote came from. given the data is already loaded but i don&#039;t have access to it and i want to make a list of the candidates, what is the best way to do it? i thought about making an array matrix with [n][40] for n amount of candidates and going through it for every instance of the struct vector, checking if the names are equal to any already loaded in my array and loading it into a new place if not. But it seems inefficient, feels like if there&#039;s a lot of candidates and a lot of votes it would be slow as shit. I don&#039;t know any fancy libraries yet either, just the standard stuff and string. So what would be the best way to do this?

Why do you think it wouldn&#039;t work? Assuming your picture is correct, there are no circular dependencies. Imagine if instead of both the &quot;big function file class&quot; and &quot;main&quot; files importing from something you wrote, they imported something from the standard library, like os. If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;.
br

br
You need to watch out for circular dependencies in Python, though if your program even starts to run it probably means you don&#039;t have any.

I know. It&#039;s math. But if programming was like math we wouldn&#039;t have that argument. Point is that programming is very subjective and you use empirical results to show something is good.
Can someone help me understand this...
br

br
It seems to me that having variables defined outside the function scope is bad practice, unless you&#039;re using OOP.
br

br
Consider this in Java, which is completely acceptable because foo is an instance variable.
br

pre class="prettyprint"
class FooBar {
br
    int foo = 1
br
    public int fooBar(int bar) {
br
      return foo + bar;
br
    }
br
}
br

/pre

br
Now take the classless equivalent in Clojure (or JavaScript whatever).
br

pre class="prettyprint"
(def foo 1)
br
(defn foobar
br
    [bar]
br
    (+ foo bar))
br

/pre

br
It seems to me that foo should be defined in the function since they have no obvious relation other than being in the same file (whereas in OOP, they are related by class). This adds tight coupling...
br

br
However, this leads to a problem if foo is a variable shared by a bunch of other functions. So we&#039;re back to the problem of having a function tightly coupled with floating variables.

I was hoping for some sort of clever hashing solution where you collapse the key input range 1-10 to 1 and then do a lookup using that.

if the ranges dont overlap then that&#039;s a further optimisation you can make on the search because min and max values can be used to search

Is that the full complexity of the problem? Obviously the example you gave can be solved with an if-else. Are there going to be lots of those ranges? Can new ranges be added? I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a hash function to do this

Well if you were writing a compiler for a more complex language there&#039;s all sort of additional stuff to do like optimisation.

br
&quot;compiler&quot; is a pretty broad term that just means translating one programming language into another. but yeah because brainfuck is so simple, you get to skip many compilation stages and just directly translate each brainfuck command. the grammar is completely context-free. don&#039;t need syntax trees, state machines, regular expressions etc.

Question for native English speakers:
br

br

span class="quote"
&gt;f shall return a promise whose fulfilment indicates that the work is done.
/span

br

br
Is this grammatically correct English? How can the sentence be improved for readability?
People actually read dpt.txt?
br
For what purpose?

a href="#p71717884" class="quotelink"

br
Sounds fine to me

a href="#p71717884" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71717884
/a

br
The word &quot;shall&quot; is used instead of will with the pronouns &quot;I&quot; (or &quot;we&quot;), for example
br

span class="quote"
&gt;I shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;We shall write code
/span

br

br
The following are wrong
br

span class="quote"
&gt;He shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;It shall write code
/span

br

br
But more importantly &quot;shall&quot;, in modern English, can simply be replaced with &quot;will&quot; on all occasions, otherwise you risk sounding pompous and archaic.
br

br
To improve readability, your sentence should actually not use &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;will&quot; but rather
br

br

span class="quote"
&gt;f returns a promise whose fulfilment indicates that the work is done.

br
I&#039;m telling you the technical usage for &quot;shall&quot; just as an aside, the main message is that &quot;shall&quot; shouldn&#039;t really be used at all except for stylistic effect (e.g. emulating some archaic vernacular).

I don&#039;t know if I should use threading here or remodel my network. I don&#039;t have the code with me so I will do my best to describe it
br

br
I have neural network that loads stuff from file and then does the session and initialize variables. This is in the same function as the whole network model is in (As they share variables).
br

br
Then I have another .py that uses tkinter to draw images which I then save using PIL and then they go into the network.
br

br
So because of the sess variable(I believe) I can only do 1 image and then I need to close and start the .py again
br

br
So I wonder if I should re model my network so it work on multiple images when I start it or use threading.

Because symbol-hell(see also: symbol-vomit) is in reference to the newbie incomprehensibility of densely symboled statements. Like

IE, you can have languages that are full of symbols that are attractive and languages that have no symbols that are ugly.

I have about three years of a job free life left. I am a stay at home parent whos interested in learning about programming in depth. I used to live in the bay area california, but I am still very close by. If you were me would you go back to school to study programming to get a degree, or would you learn it on your own fully? Also, what areas of programming should I focus on based on where I live?

I started by porting my low level C library to Rust. Those functions were unsafe since they did OS shit. Then I wrapped it up in a strongly typed interface. I tested extern &quot;C&quot; and it literally became a drop-in replacement for my C library. I barely learned the language and managed to reproduce months worth of C work on my library

the demand for *skilled* tech workers is huge, it&#039;s just not being met. the market is massively oversaturated with retards with degrees. i&#039;ve seen a job posting for a senior engine programmer position at bungie which listed &quot;experience with optimization&quot; under &quot;nice to haves&quot;. i mean jesus christ. ever think about how there were games on the 360/PS3 that ran at 60fps and looked good, and now it seems like the majority of console games are struggling to do the same on hardware with like 5 times the processing power and 16 times the memory? the industry is desperate for skilled workers, but they&#039;re not finding many thanks to the college bubble

char location[40];

br
which are instances of something (let&#039;s say a vote) so there can be multiple instances containing the same person but a different location where the vote came from. given the data is already loaded but i don&#039;t have access to it and i want to make a list of the candidates, what is the best way to do it? i thought about making an array matrix with [n][40] for n amount of candidates and going through it for every instance of the struct vector, checking if the names are equal to any already loaded in my array and loading it into a new place if not. But it seems inefficient, feels like if there&#039;s a lot of candidates and a lot of votes it would be slow as shit. I don&#039;t know any fancy libraries yet either, just the standard stuff and string. So what would be the best way to do this?

i have on small test, it works, but i don&#039;t want to ruin my big project and am not sure if it will work there too, guess i should try it on actual project by copying, also the reason for which i am asking is this i have a certain way in my mind that uses this thing, but i am not going to work on it for now, but when i do work on it after a while and the way that i have in mind fails, i would have to study a little and find a new solution all over again, but you are right it isn&#039;t a biggie to check i was just being lazy

Why do you think it wouldn&#039;t work? Assuming your picture is correct, there are no circular dependencies. Imagine if instead of both the &quot;big function file class&quot; and &quot;main&quot; files importing from something you wrote, they imported something from the standard library, like os. If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;.
br

br
You need to watch out for circular dependencies in Python, though if your program even starts to run it probably means you don&#039;t have any.

This doesn&#039;t make sense to me. Syntax should be one of the first things you settle on. Why would he change the syntax after already writing an entire project with it? I seriously doubt he&#039;s going to change it, it just looks like another symbol-hell of a language like C++

I know. It&#039;s math. But if programming was like math we wouldn&#039;t have that argument. Point is that programming is very subjective and you use empirical results to show something is good.
Can someone help me understand this...
br

br
It seems to me that having variables defined outside the function scope is bad practice, unless you&#039;re using OOP.
br

br
Consider this in Java, which is completely acceptable because foo is an instance variable.
br

pre class="prettyprint"
class FooBar {
br
    int foo = 1
br
    public int fooBar(int bar) {
br
      return foo + bar;
br
    }
br
}
br

/pre

br
Now take the classless equivalent in Clojure (or JavaScript whatever).
br

pre class="prettyprint"
(def foo 1)
br
(defn foobar
br
    [bar]
br
    (+ foo bar))
br

/pre

br
It seems to me that foo should be defined in the function since they have no obvious relation other than being in the same file (whereas in OOP, they are related by class). This adds tight coupling...
br

br
However, this leads to a problem if foo is a variable shared by a bunch of other functions. So we&#039;re back to the problem of having a function tightly coupled with floating variables.

Isn&#039;t it wiser to just record min and max in two sorted arrays and then search for where the value belongs in those and associate each min with an index to use for an array containing the value?

br
I was hoping for some sort of clever hashing solution where you collapse the key input range 1-10 to 1 and then do a lookup using that.

I&#039;m telling you the technical usage for &quot;shall&quot; just as an aside, the main message is that &quot;shall&quot; shouldn&#039;t really be used at all except for stylistic effect (e.g. emulating some archaic vernacular).

I don&#039;t know if I should use threading here or remodel my network. I don&#039;t have the code with me so I will do my best to describe it
br

br
I have neural network that loads stuff from file and then does the session and initialize variables. This is in the same function as the whole network model is in (As they share variables).
br

br
Then I have another .py that uses tkinter to draw images which I then save using PIL and then they go into the network.
br

br
So because of the sess variable(I believe) I can only do 1 image and then I need to close and start the .py again
br

br
So I wonder if I should re model my network so it work on multiple images when I start it or use threading.
br
I am dummy dum please no bully
Our .net project work has some unit test that work on every machine and server, except mine. They all crash because they can&#039;t find a .dll that comes with Blend, which I installed with Visual Studio 2017. The file is physically in the right directories, how can I tell VC to use it, without editing the project? (Since it works everywhere my PC is clearly at fault)

a href="#p71718467" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71718467

br
how? I think it&#039;s ugly because it&#039;s got fucking symbols all over the place, even if I know what they do, it&#039;s shit to read and more importantly it&#039;s shit to write

a href="#p71718490" class="quotelink"

br
Because symbol-hell(see also: symbol-vomit) is in reference to the newbie incomprehensibility of densely symboled statements. Like 
pre class="prettyprint"
([&amp;]{/*blah blah*/}()[[]{/*blah blah*/}])
/pre
 
br

br
IE, you can have languages that are full of symbols that are attractive and languages that have no symbols that are ugly.

I have about three years of a job free life left. I am a stay at home parent whos interested in learning about programming in depth. I used to live in the bay area california, but I am still very close by. If you were me would you go back to school to study programming to get a degree, or would you learn it on your own fully? Also, what areas of programming should I focus on based on where I live? I want to take advantage of my location as much as possible and make every day studying count, so i want to choose the right path.

the demand for *skilled* tech workers is huge, it&#039;s just not being met. the market is massively oversaturated with retards with degrees. i&#039;ve seen a job posting for a senior engine programmer position at bungie which listed &quot;experience with optimization&quot; under &quot;nice to haves&quot;. i mean jesus christ. ever think about how there were games on the 360/PS3 that ran at 60fps and looked good, and now it seems like the majority of console games are struggling to do the same on hardware with like 5 times the processing power and 16 times the memory? the industry is desperate for skilled workers, but they&#039;re not finding many thanks to the college bubble

so in c, i have an array of structures with say

char name[40];

char sex;
br
char location[40];

}

br

br
which are instances of something (let&#039;s say a vote) so there can be multiple instances containing the same person but a different location where the vote came from. given the data is already loaded but i don&#039;t have access to it and i want to make a list of the candidates, what is the best way to do it? i thought about making an array matrix with [n][40] for n amount of candidates and going through it for every instance of the struct vector, checking if the names are equal to any already loaded in my array and loading it into a new place if not. But it seems inefficient, feels like if there&#039;s a lot of candidates and a lot of votes it would be slow as shit. I don&#039;t know any fancy libraries yet either, just the standard stuff and string. So what would be the best way to do this?

Why do you think it wouldn&#039;t work? Assuming your picture is correct, there are no circular dependencies. Imagine if instead of both the &quot;big function file class&quot; and &quot;main&quot; files importing from something you wrote, they imported something from the standard library, like os. If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;.
br

br
You need to watch out for circular dependencies in Python, though if your program even starts to run it probably means you don&#039;t have any.

I know. It&#039;s math. But if programming was like math we wouldn&#039;t have that argument. Point is that programming is very subjective and you use empirical results to show something is good.
Can someone help me understand this...
br

br
It seems to me that having variables defined outside the function scope is bad practice, unless you&#039;re using OOP.
br

br
Consider this in Java, which is completely acceptable because foo is an instance variable.
br

pre class="prettyprint"
class FooBar {
br
    int foo = 1
br
    public int fooBar(int bar) {
br
      return foo + bar;
br
    }
br
}
br

/pre

br
Now take the classless equivalent in Clojure (or JavaScript whatever).
br

pre class="prettyprint"
(def foo 1)
br
(defn foobar
br
    [bar]
br
    (+ foo bar))
br

/pre

br
It seems to me that foo should be defined in the function since they have no obvious relation other than being in the same file (whereas in OOP, they are related by class). This adds tight coupling...
br

br
However, this leads to a problem if foo is a variable shared by a bunch of other functions. So we&#039;re back to the problem of having a function tightly coupled with floating variables.

Are programmers more left leaning or right leaning, politically? I&#039;ve seen a pretty strong split. Like half are liberal SJW beta types, while the other half into Trump and the alt-right.

Pretty sure there&#039;s nothing inherent to programming that makes programmers left/right aligned.
br
It&#039;s more likely just the culture in the location where programmers are that dictate that.

If programmers gave a shit about politics they wouldn&#039;t be writing programs, instead they would be busy worshiping marx/hitler all day long instead.

And also, by most of 4chan&#039;s standard, anyone who is not a trump worshiper is a commie, so in their perspective 99.9% of the programmers in the world are commies.

Is there a range based associative array?

a href="#p71717367" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71717367

br
So I would search the collection for a range containing my key and then extract the associated value?
br
Isn&#039;t it wiser to just record min and max in two sorted arrays and then search for where the value belongs in those and associate each min with an index to use for an array containing the value?
br

br
I was hoping for some sort of clever hashing solution where you collapse the key input range 1-10 to 1 and then do a lookup using that.
br

br
I have a lot of ranges to deal with.

br
You can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key, I dont quite understand your two sorted arrays idea, it doesn&#039;t sound like makes sense
br
if the ranges dont overlap then that&#039;s a further optimisation you can make on the search because min and max values can be used to search

No the ranges shouldn&#039;t overlap. I don&#039;t want two values returned from a lookup.

&gt;you can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key
/span

br
I don&#039;t follow. When I do a lookup I will just have an integer. It might belong to one of the ranges in the set.
br
Are you saying that I should store the ranges somewhere and store the values separately using a map that uses the min and max as a key?
br
I&#039;m not all that concerned with the range-&gt;value step it&#039;s the key-&gt;range that I fear will take time.

Is that the full complexity of the problem? Obviously the example you gave can be solved with an if-else. Are there going to be lots of those ranges? Can new ranges be added? I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a hash function to do this

br
&quot;compiler&quot; is a pretty broad term that just means translating one programming language into another. but yeah because brainfuck is so simple, you get to skip many compilation stages and just directly translate each brainfuck command. the grammar is completely context-free. don&#039;t need syntax trees, state machines, regular expressions etc.

The word &quot;shall&quot; is used instead of will with the pronouns &quot;I&quot; (or &quot;we&quot;), for example
br

span class="quote"
&gt;I shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;We shall write code
/span

br

br
The following are wrong
br

span class="quote"
&gt;He shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;It shall write code
/span

br

br
But more importantly &quot;shall&quot;, in modern English, can simply be replaced with &quot;will&quot; on all occasions, otherwise you risk sounding pompous and archaic.
br

br
To improve readability, your sentence should actually not use &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;will&quot; but rather
br

I don&#039;t know if I should use threading here or remodel my network. I don&#039;t have the code with me so I will do my best to describe it
br

br
I have neural network that loads stuff from file and then does the session and initialize variables. This is in the same function as the whole network model is in (As they share variables).
br

br
Then I have another .py that uses tkinter to draw images which I then save using PIL and then they go into the network.
br

br
So because of the sess variable(I believe) I can only do 1 image and then I need to close and start the .py again
br

br
So I wonder if I should re model my network so it work on multiple images when I start it or use threading.
br

how? I think it&#039;s ugly because it&#039;s got fucking symbols all over the place, even if I know what they do, it&#039;s shit to read and more importantly it&#039;s shit to write

a href="#p71718490" class="quotelink"

Because symbol-hell(see also: symbol-vomit) is in reference to the newbie incomprehensibility of densely symboled statements. Like 
pre class="prettyprint"
([&amp;]{/*blah blah*/}()[[]{/*blah blah*/}])
/pre
 
br

br
IE, you can have languages that are full of symbols that are attractive and languages that have no symbols that are ugly.

I have about three years of a job free life left. I am a stay at home parent whos interested in learning about programming in depth. I used to live in the bay area california, but I am still very close by. If you were me would you go back to school to study programming to get a degree, or would you learn it on your own fully? Also, what areas of programming should I focus on based on where I live? I want to take advantage of my location as much as possible and make every day studying count, so i want to choose the right path.

Converting from using a std::vector&lt;std::array&lt;float, 3&gt; &gt; to a std::vector&lt;glm::vec3&gt; made things much easier.

so in c, i have an array of structures with say

char sex;

char location[40];

br
which are instances of something (let&#039;s say a vote) so there can be multiple instances containing the same person but a different location where the vote came from. given the data is already loaded but i don&#039;t have access to it and i want to make a list of the candidates, what is the best way to do it? i thought about making an array matrix with [n][40] for n amount of candidates and going through it for every instance of the struct vector, checking if the names are equal to any already loaded in my array and loading it into a new place if not. But it seems inefficient, feels like if there&#039;s a lot of candidates and a lot of votes it would be slow as shit. I don&#039;t know any fancy libraries yet either, just the standard stuff and string. So what would be the best way to do this?

Why do you think it wouldn&#039;t work? Assuming your picture is correct, there are no circular dependencies. Imagine if instead of both the &quot;big function file class&quot; and &quot;main&quot; files importing from something you wrote, they imported something from the standard library, like os. If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;.
br

br
You need to watch out for circular dependencies in Python, though if your program even starts to run it probably means you don&#039;t have any.

I know. It&#039;s math. But if programming was like math we wouldn&#039;t have that argument. Point is that programming is very subjective and you use empirical results to show something is good.
Can someone help me understand this...
br

br
It seems to me that having variables defined outside the function scope is bad practice, unless you&#039;re using OOP.
br

br
Consider this in Java, which is completely acceptable because foo is an instance variable.
br

pre class="prettyprint"
class FooBar {
br
    int foo = 1
br
    public int fooBar(int bar) {
br
      return foo + bar;
br
    }
br
}
br

/pre

br
Now take the classless equivalent in Clojure (or JavaScript whatever).
br

pre class="prettyprint"
(def foo 1)
br
(defn foobar
br
    [bar]
br
    (+ foo bar))
br

/pre

br
It seems to me that foo should be defined in the function since they have no obvious relation other than being in the same file (whereas in OOP, they are related by class). This adds tight coupling...
br

br
However, this leads to a problem if foo is a variable shared by a bunch of other functions. So we&#039;re back to the problem of having a function tightly coupled with floating variables.

And also, by most of 4chan&#039;s standard, anyone who is not a trump worshiper is a commie, so in their perspective 99.9% of the programmers in the world are commies.

Why datastructure should I use for this? An associative array would have a lot of entries and that doesn&#039;t make much sense.
br
Is there a range based associative array?

a collection of ranges

a href="#p71717367" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71717367

br
So I would search the collection for a range containing my key and then extract the associated value?
br
Isn&#039;t it wiser to just record min and max in two sorted arrays and then search for where the value belongs in those and associate each min with an index to use for an array containing the value?
br

br
I was hoping for some sort of clever hashing solution where you collapse the key input range 1-10 to 1 and then do a lookup using that.
br

br
I have a lot of ranges to deal with.

br
You can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key, I dont quite understand your two sorted arrays idea, it doesn&#039;t sound like makes sense
br
if the ranges dont overlap then that&#039;s a further optimisation you can make on the search because min and max values can be used to search

No the ranges shouldn&#039;t overlap. I don&#039;t want two values returned from a lookup.
br

span class="quote"
&gt;you can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key
/span

br
I don&#039;t follow. When I do a lookup I will just have an integer. It might belong to one of the ranges in the set.
br
Are you saying that I should store the ranges somewhere and store the values separately using a map that uses the min and max as a key?
br
I&#039;m not all that concerned with the range-&gt;value step it&#039;s the key-&gt;range that I fear will take time.

Is that the full complexity of the problem? Obviously the example you gave can be solved with an if-else. Are there going to be lots of those ranges? Can new ranges be added? I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a hash function to do this

Well if you were writing a compiler for a more complex language there&#039;s all sort of additional stuff to do like optimisation.

br
&quot;compiler&quot; is a pretty broad term that just means translating one programming language into another. but yeah because brainfuck is so simple, you get to skip many compilation stages and just directly translate each brainfuck command. the grammar is completely context-free. don&#039;t need syntax trees, state machines, regular expressions etc.

Question for native English speakers:

Is this grammatically correct English? How can the sentence be improved for readability?

br
The word &quot;shall&quot; is used instead of will with the pronouns &quot;I&quot; (or &quot;we&quot;), for example
br

span class="quote"
&gt;I shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;We shall write code
/span

br

br
The following are wrong
br

span class="quote"
&gt;He shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;It shall write code
/span

br

br
But more importantly &quot;shall&quot;, in modern English, can simply be replaced with &quot;will&quot; on all occasions, otherwise you risk sounding pompous and archaic.
br

br
To improve readability, your sentence should actually not use &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;will&quot; but rather
br

br

span class="quote"
&gt;f returns a promise whose fulfilment indicates that the work is done.

I&#039;m telling you the technical usage for &quot;shall&quot; just as an aside, the main message is that &quot;shall&quot; shouldn&#039;t really be used at all except for stylistic effect (e.g. emulating some archaic vernacular).

I don&#039;t know if I should use threading here or remodel my network. I don&#039;t have the code with me so I will do my best to describe it
br

br
I have neural network that loads stuff from file and then does the session and initialize variables. This is in the same function as the whole network model is in (As they share variables).
br

br
Then I have another .py that uses tkinter to draw images which I then save using PIL and then they go into the network.
br

br
So because of the sess variable(I believe) I can only do 1 image and then I need to close and start the .py again
br

br
So I wonder if I should re model my network so it work on multiple images when I start it or use threading.

IE, you can have languages that are full of symbols that are attractive and languages that have no symbols that are ugly.

I have about three years of a job free life left. I am a stay at home parent whos interested in learning about programming in depth. I used to live in the bay area california, but I am still very close by. If you were me would you go back to school to study programming to get a degree, or would you learn it on your own fully? Also, what areas of programming should I focus on based on where I live? I want to take advantage of my location as much as possible and make every day studying count, so i want to choose the right path.

There are going to be bullshit classes that have nothing to do with programming and is going to hinder your progress.

Programming classes will force you to do certain things just because.

New thread, new excitement from me that the numbers for my imported models vertex/normal elements seems to be correct. Converting from using a std::vector&lt;std::array&lt;float, 3&gt; &gt; to a std::vector&lt;glm::vec3&gt; made things much easier.

I started by porting my low level C library to Rust. Those functions were unsafe since they did OS shit. Then I wrapped it up in a strongly typed interface.

so in c, i have an array of structures with say
br

pre class="prettyprint"
struct stuff{
br
char name[40];
br
char sex;
br
char location[40];
br
}
/pre

br

br
which are instances of something (let&#039;s say a vote) so there can be multiple instances containing the same person but a different location where the vote came from. given the data is already loaded but i don&#039;t have access to it and i want to make a list of the candidates, what is the best way to do it? i thought about making an array matrix with [n][40] for n amount of candidates and going through it for every instance of the struct vector, checking if the names are equal to any already loaded in my array and loading it into a new place if not. But it seems inefficient, feels like if there&#039;s a lot of candidates and a lot of votes it would be slow as shit. I don&#039;t know any fancy libraries yet either, just the standard stuff and string. So what would be the best way to do this?

Why do you think it wouldn&#039;t work? Assuming your picture is correct, there are no circular dependencies. Imagine if instead of both the &quot;big function file class&quot; and &quot;main&quot; files importing from something you wrote, they imported something from the standard library, like os. If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;.
br

br
You need to watch out for circular dependencies in Python, though if your program even starts to run it probably means you don&#039;t have any.

I know. It&#039;s math. But if programming was like math we wouldn&#039;t have that argument. Point is that programming is very subjective and you use empirical results to show something is good.
Can someone help me understand this...
br

br
It seems to me that having variables defined outside the function scope is bad practice, unless you&#039;re using OOP.
br

br
Consider this in Java, which is completely acceptable because foo is an instance variable.
br

pre class="prettyprint"
class FooBar {
br
    int foo = 1
br
    public int fooBar(int bar) {
br
      return foo + bar;
br
    }
br
}
br

/pre

br
Now take the classless equivalent in Clojure (or JavaScript whatever).
br

pre class="prettyprint"
(def foo 1)
br
(defn foobar
br
    [bar]
br
    (+ foo bar))
br

/pre

br
It seems to me that foo should be defined in the function since they have no obvious relation other than being in the same file (whereas in OOP, they are related by class). This adds tight coupling...
br

br
However, this leads to a problem if foo is a variable shared by a bunch of other functions. So we&#039;re back to the problem of having a function tightly coupled with floating variables.

Say I want to map

[1,10) to &#039;Small&#039; and [10, 20] to &#039;Big&#039;.
br
Why datastructure should I use for this? An associative array would have a lot of entries and that doesn&#039;t make much sense.
br
Is there a range based associative array?
are recursive-descent parsers the industry&#039;s standard?

a href="#p71717346" class="quotelink"

/a

br
a collection of ranges

a href="#p71717367" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71717367
/a

br
So I would search the collection for a range containing my key and then extract the associated value?
br
Isn&#039;t it wiser to just record min and max in two sorted arrays and then search for where the value belongs in those and associate each min with an index to use for an array containing the value?
br

br
I was hoping for some sort of clever hashing solution where you collapse the key input range 1-10 to 1 and then do a lookup using that.
br

br
I have a lot of ranges to deal with.

a href="#p71717407" class="quotelink"

br
You can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key, I dont quite understand your two sorted arrays idea, it doesn&#039;t sound like makes sense
br
if the ranges dont overlap then that&#039;s a further optimisation you can make on the search because min and max values can be used to search

No the ranges shouldn&#039;t overlap. I don&#039;t want two values returned from a lookup.
br

span class="quote"
&gt;you can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key
/span

br
I don&#039;t follow. When I do a lookup I will just have an integer. It might belong to one of the ranges in the set.
br
Are you saying that I should store the ranges somewhere and store the values separately using a map that uses the min and max as a key?
br
I&#039;m not all that concerned with the range-&gt;value step it&#039;s the key-&gt;range that I fear will take time.

Is that the full complexity of the problem? Obviously the example you gave can be solved with an if-else. Are there going to be lots of those ranges? Can new ranges be added? I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a hash function to do this

br
&quot;compiler&quot; is a pretty broad term that just means translating one programming language into another. but yeah because brainfuck is so simple, you get to skip many compilation stages and just directly translate each brainfuck command. the grammar is completely context-free. don&#039;t need syntax trees, state machines, regular expressions etc.

Question for native English speakers:

span class="quote"
&gt;f shall return a promise whose fulfilment indicates that the work is done.
/span

br

br
Is this grammatically correct English? How can the sentence be improved for readability?
People actually read dpt.txt?
br
For what purpose?

a href="#p71717884" class="quotelink"

Sounds fine to me

a href="#p71717884" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71717884
/a

br
The word &quot;shall&quot; is used instead of will with the pronouns &quot;I&quot; (or &quot;we&quot;), for example
br

span class="quote"
&gt;I shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;We shall write code
/span

br

br
The following are wrong
br

span class="quote"
&gt;He shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;It shall write code
/span

br

br
But more importantly &quot;shall&quot;, in modern English, can simply be replaced with &quot;will&quot; on all occasions, otherwise you risk sounding pompous and archaic.
br

br
To improve readability, your sentence should actually not use &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;will&quot; but rather
br

br

span class="quote"
&gt;f returns a promise whose fulfilment indicates that the work is done.

I don&#039;t know if I should use threading here or remodel my network. I don&#039;t have the code with me so I will do my best to describe it
br

br
I have neural network that loads stuff from file and then does the session and initialize variables. This is in the same function as the whole network model is in (As they share variables).
br

br
Then I have another .py that uses tkinter to draw images which I then save using PIL and then they go into the network.
br

br
So because of the sess variable(I believe) I can only do 1 image and then I need to close and start the .py again
br

br
So I wonder if I should re model my network so it work on multiple images when I start it or use threading.
br

IE, you can have languages that are full of symbols that are attractive and languages that have no symbols that are ugly.

Also converting the data structure I use for holding 3 vertices now uses an array instead of 3 separate members called vertex1, vertex2, vertex3. Woot!

I started by porting my low level C library to Rust. Those functions were unsafe since they did OS shit. Then I wrapped it up in a strongly typed interface.

the demand for *skilled* tech workers is huge, it&#039;s just not being met. the market is massively oversaturated with retards with degrees. i&#039;ve seen a job posting for a senior engine programmer position at bungie which listed &quot;experience with optimization&quot; under &quot;nice to haves&quot;. i mean jesus christ. ever think about how there were games on the 360/PS3 that ran at 60fps and looked good, and now it seems like the majority of console games are struggling to do the same on hardware with like 5 times the processing power and 16 times the memory? the industry is desperate for skilled workers, but they&#039;re not finding many thanks to the college bubble

br

br
which are instances of something (let&#039;s say a vote) so there can be multiple instances containing the same person but a different location where the vote came from. given the data is already loaded but i don&#039;t have access to it and i want to make a list of the candidates, what is the best way to do it? i thought about making an array matrix with [n][40] for n amount of candidates and going through it for every instance of the struct vector, checking if the names are equal to any already loaded in my array and loading it into a new place if not. But it seems inefficient, feels like if there&#039;s a lot of candidates and a lot of votes it would be slow as shit. I don&#039;t know any fancy libraries yet either, just the standard stuff and string. So what would be the best way to do this?

Why do you think it wouldn&#039;t work? Assuming your picture is correct, there are no circular dependencies. Imagine if instead of both the &quot;big function file class&quot; and &quot;main&quot; files importing from something you wrote, they imported something from the standard library, like os. If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;.
br

br
You need to watch out for circular dependencies in Python, though if your program even starts to run it probably means you don&#039;t have any.

I know. It&#039;s math. But if programming was like math we wouldn&#039;t have that argument. Point is that programming is very subjective and you use empirical results to show something is good.
Can someone help me understand this...
br

br
It seems to me that having variables defined outside the function scope is bad practice, unless you&#039;re using OOP.
br

br
Consider this in Java, which is completely acceptable because foo is an instance variable.
br

pre class="prettyprint"
class FooBar {
br
    int foo = 1
br
    public int fooBar(int bar) {
br
      return foo + bar;
br
    }
br
}
br

/pre

br
Now take the classless equivalent in Clojure (or JavaScript whatever).
br

pre class="prettyprint"
(def foo 1)
br
(defn foobar
br
    [bar]
br
    (+ foo bar))
br

/pre

br
It seems to me that foo should be defined in the function since they have no obvious relation other than being in the same file (whereas in OOP, they are related by class). This adds tight coupling...
br

br
However, this leads to a problem if foo is a variable shared by a bunch of other functions. So we&#039;re back to the problem of having a function tightly coupled with floating variables.

br
I was hoping for some sort of clever hashing solution where you collapse the key input range 1-10 to 1 and then do a lookup using that.

if the ranges dont overlap then that&#039;s a further optimisation you can make on the search because min and max values can be used to search

I don&#039;t follow. When I do a lookup I will just have an integer. It might belong to one of the ranges in the set.

It&#039;s technically a compiler but isn&#039;t it more an exercise in writing a parser?

br
Well if you were writing a compiler for a more complex language there&#039;s all sort of additional stuff to do like optimisation.

a href="#p71717760" class="quotelink"

br
&quot;compiler&quot; is a pretty broad term that just means translating one programming language into another. but yeah because brainfuck is so simple, you get to skip many compilation stages and just directly translate each brainfuck command. the grammar is completely context-free. don&#039;t need syntax trees, state machines, regular expressions etc.

Question for native English speakers:
br

br

span class="quote"
&gt;f shall return a promise whose fulfilment indicates that the work is done.
/span

br

br
Is this grammatically correct English? How can the sentence be improved for readability?
People actually read dpt.txt?
br
For what purpose?

a href="#p71717884" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71717884
/a

br
Sounds fine to me

a href="#p71717884" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71717884
/a

br
The word &quot;shall&quot; is used instead of will with the pronouns &quot;I&quot; (or &quot;we&quot;), for example
br

span class="quote"
&gt;I shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;We shall write code
/span

br

br
The following are wrong
br

span class="quote"
&gt;He shall write code
/span

br

span class="quote"
&gt;It shall write code
/span

br

br
But more importantly &quot;shall&quot;, in modern English, can simply be replaced with &quot;will&quot; on all occasions, otherwise you risk sounding pompous and archaic.
br

br
To improve readability, your sentence should actually not use &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;will&quot; but rather
br

br

span class="quote"
&gt;f returns a promise whose fulfilment indicates that the work is done.
/span

br
I&#039;m telling you the technical usage for &quot;shall&quot; just as an aside, the main message is that &quot;shall&quot; shouldn&#039;t really be used at all except for stylistic effect (e.g. emulating some archaic vernacular).

I don&#039;t know if I should use threading here or remodel my network. I don&#039;t have the code with me so I will do my best to describe it
br

br
I have neural network that loads stuff from file and then does the session and initialize variables. This is in the same function as the whole network model is in (As they share variables).
br

br
Then I have another .py that uses tkinter to draw images which I then save using PIL and then they go into the network.
br

br
So because of the sess variable(I believe) I can only do 1 image and then I need to close and start the .py again
br

br
So I wonder if I should re model my network so it work on multiple images when I start it or use threading.
br
I am dummy dum please no bully
Our .net project work has some unit test that work on every machine and server, except mine. They all crash because they can&#039;t find a .dll that comes with Blend, which I installed with Visual Studio 2017.

a href="#p71718467" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71718467

br
how? I think it&#039;s ugly because it&#039;s got fucking symbols all over the place, even if I know what they do, it&#039;s shit to read and more importantly it&#039;s shit to write

a href="#p71718490" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71718490
/a

br
Because symbol-hell(see also: symbol-vomit) is in reference to the newbie incomprehensibility of densely symboled statements. Like 
pre class="prettyprint"
([&amp;]{/*blah blah*/}()[[]{/*blah blah*/}])
/pre
 
br

br
IE, you can have languages that are full of symbols that are attractive and languages that have no symbols that are ugly.

I have about three years of a job free life left. I am a stay at home parent whos interested in learning about programming in depth. I used to live in the bay area california, but I am still very close by. If you were me would you go back to school to study programming to get a degree, or would you learn it on your own fully? Also, what areas of programming should I focus on based on where I live? I want to take advantage of my location as much as possible and make every day studying count, so i want to choose the right path.

I started by porting my low level C library to Rust. Those functions were unsafe since they did OS shit. Then I wrapped it up in a strongly typed interface. I tested extern &quot;C&quot; and it literally became a drop-in replacement for my C library. I barely learned the language and managed to reproduce months worth of C work on my library

char location[40];

which are instances of something (let&#039;s say a vote) so there can be multiple instances containing the same person but a different location where the vote came from. given the data is already loaded but i don&#039;t have access to it and i want to make a list of the candidates, what is the best way to do it? i thought about making an array matrix with [n][40] for n amount of candidates and going through it for every instance of the struct vector, checking if the names are equal to any already loaded in my array and loading it into a new place if not. But it seems inefficient, feels like if there&#039;s a lot of candidates and a lot of votes it would be slow as shit. I don&#039;t know any fancy libraries yet either, just the standard stuff and string. So what would be the best way to do this?

i have on small test, it works, but i don&#039;t want to ruin my big project and am not sure if it will work there too, guess i should try it on actual project by copying, also the reason for which i am asking is this i have a certain way in my mind that uses this thing, but i am not going to work on it for now, but when i do work on it after a while and the way that i have in mind fails, i would have to study a little and find a new solution all over again, but you are right it isn&#039;t a biggie to check i was just being lazy

Why do you think it wouldn&#039;t work? Assuming your picture is correct, there are no circular dependencies. Imagine if instead of both the &quot;big function file class&quot; and &quot;main&quot; files importing from something you wrote, they imported something from the standard library, like os. If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;.
br

br
You need to watch out for circular dependencies in Python, though if your program even starts to run it probably means you don&#039;t have any.

I know. It&#039;s math. But if programming was like math we wouldn&#039;t have that argument. Point is that programming is very subjective and you use empirical results to show something is good.
Can someone help me understand this...
br

br
It seems to me that having variables defined outside the function scope is bad practice, unless you&#039;re using OOP.
br

br
Consider this in Java, which is completely acceptable because foo is an instance variable.
br

pre class="prettyprint"
class FooBar {
br
    int foo = 1
br
    public int fooBar(int bar) {
br
      return foo + bar;
br
    }
br
}
br

/pre

br
Now take the classless equivalent in Clojure (or JavaScript whatever).
br

pre class="prettyprint"
(def foo 1)
br
(defn foobar
br
    [bar]
br
    (+ foo bar))
br

/pre

br
It seems to me that foo should be defined in the function since they have no obvious relation other than being in the same file (whereas in OOP, they are related by class). This adds tight coupling...
br

br
However, this leads to a problem if foo is a variable shared by a bunch of other functions. So we&#039;re back to the problem of having a function tightly coupled with floating variables.

Isn&#039;t it wiser to just record min and max in two sorted arrays and then search for where the value belongs in those and associate each min with an index to use for an array containing the value?

br
I was hoping for some sort of clever hashing solution where you collapse the key input range 1-10 to 1 and then do a lookup using that.

I don&#039;t know if I should use threading here or remodel my network. I don&#039;t have the code with me so I will do my best to describe it
br

br
I have neural network that loads stuff from file and then does the session and initialize variables. This is in the same function as the whole network model is in (As they share variables).
br

br
Then I have another .py that uses tkinter to draw images which I then save using PIL and then they go into the network.
br

br
So because of the sess variable(I believe) I can only do 1 image and then I need to close and start the .py again
br

br
So I wonder if I should re model my network so it work on multiple images when I start it or use threading.
br
I am dummy dum please no bully
Our .net project work has some unit test that work on every machine and server, except mine. They all crash because they can&#039;t find a .dll that comes with Blend, which I installed with Visual Studio 2017. The file is physically in the right directories, how can I tell VC to use it, without editing the project? (Since it works everywhere my PC is clearly at fault)

a href="#p71718467" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71718467

br
how? I think it&#039;s ugly because it&#039;s got fucking symbols all over the place, even if I know what they do, it&#039;s shit to read and more importantly it&#039;s shit to write

a href="#p71718490" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71718490

br
Because symbol-hell(see also: symbol-vomit) is in reference to the newbie incomprehensibility of densely symboled statements. Like 
pre class="prettyprint"
([&amp;]{/*blah blah*/}()[[]{/*blah blah*/}])
/pre
 
br

br
IE, you can have languages that are full of symbols that are attractive and languages that have no symbols that are ugly.

I have about three years of a job free life left. I am a stay at home parent whos interested in learning about programming in depth. I used to live in the bay area california, but I am still very close by. If you were me would you go back to school to study programming to get a degree, or would you learn it on your own fully? Also, what areas of programming should I focus on based on where I live?

New thread, new excitement from me that the numbers for my imported models vertex/normal elements seems to be correct. Converting from using a std::vector&lt;std::array&lt;float, 3&gt; &gt; to a std::vector&lt;glm::vec3&gt; made things much easier.

the demand for *skilled* tech workers is huge, it&#039;s just not being met. the market is massively oversaturated with retards with degrees. i&#039;ve seen a job posting for a senior engine programmer position at bungie which listed &quot;experience with optimization&quot; under &quot;nice to haves&quot;. i mean jesus christ. ever think about how there were games on the 360/PS3 that ran at 60fps and looked good, and now it seems like the majority of console games are struggling to do the same on hardware with like 5 times the processing power and 16 times the memory? the industry is desperate for skilled workers, but they&#039;re not finding many thanks to the college bubble

so in c, i have an array of structures with say

char sex;
br
char location[40];

}

br

br
which are instances of something (let&#039;s say a vote) so there can be multiple instances containing the same person but a different location where the vote came from. given the data is already loaded but i don&#039;t have access to it and i want to make a list of the candidates, what is the best way to do it? i thought about making an array matrix with [n][40] for n amount of candidates and going through it for every instance of the struct vector, checking if the names are equal to any already loaded in my array and loading it into a new place if not. But it seems inefficient, feels like if there&#039;s a lot of candidates and a lot of votes it would be slow as shit. I don&#039;t know any fancy libraries yet either, just the standard stuff and string. So what would be the best way to do this?

Why do you think it wouldn&#039;t work? Assuming your picture is correct, there are no circular dependencies. Imagine if instead of both the &quot;big function file class&quot; and &quot;main&quot; files importing from something you wrote, they imported something from the standard library, like os. If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;.
br

br
You need to watch out for circular dependencies in Python, though if your program even starts to run it probably means you don&#039;t have any.

i actually was going for circular import thing, because all my functions were in main file, but it was not working, so i decided to separate all functions to a different file, but the thing you wrote &quot;If &quot;big function file class&quot; imports os, surely &quot;main&quot; can still import os after importing &quot;big function file class&quot;&quot; was the exact thing i wanted to confirm

I know. It&#039;s math. But if programming was like math we wouldn&#039;t have that argument. Point is that programming is very subjective and you use empirical results to show something is good.
Can someone help me understand this...
br

br
It seems to me that having variables defined outside the function scope is bad practice, unless you&#039;re using OOP.
br

br
Consider this in Java, which is completely acceptable because foo is an instance variable.
br

pre class="prettyprint"
class FooBar {
br
    int foo = 1
br
    public int fooBar(int bar) {
br
      return foo + bar;
br
    }
br
}
br

/pre

br
Now take the classless equivalent in Clojure (or JavaScript whatever).
br

pre class="prettyprint"
(def foo 1)
br
(defn foobar
br
    [bar]
br
    (+ foo bar))
br

/pre

br
It seems to me that foo should be defined in the function since they have no obvious relation other than being in the same file (whereas in OOP, they are related by class). This adds tight coupling...
br

br
However, this leads to a problem if foo is a variable shared by a bunch of other functions. So we&#039;re back to the problem of having a function tightly coupled with floating variables.

So I would search the collection for a range containing my key and then extract the associated value?
br
Isn&#039;t it wiser to just record min and max in two sorted arrays and then search for where the value belongs in those and associate each min with an index to use for an array containing the value?
br

br
I was hoping for some sort of clever hashing solution where you collapse the key input range 1-10 to 1 and then do a lookup using that.
br

br
I have a lot of ranges to deal with.

You can have a sorted selection which uses the min or max of the range as a key, I dont quite understand your two sorted arrays idea, it doesn&#039;t sound like makes sense
br
if the ranges dont overlap then that&#039;s a further optimisation you can make on the search because min and max values can be used to search

br
I don&#039;t follow. When I do a lookup I will just have an integer. It might belong to one of the ranges in the set.
br
Are you saying that I should store the ranges somewhere and store the values separately using a map that uses the min and max as a key?

Is that the full complexity of the problem? Obviously the example you gave can be solved with an if-else. Are there going to be lots of those ranges? Can new ranges be added? I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a hash function to do this

&quot;compiler&quot; is a pretty broad term that just means translating one programming language into another. but yeah because brainfuck is so simple, you get to skip many compilation stages and just directly translate each brainfuck command. the grammar is completely context-free. don&#039;t need syntax trees, state machines, regular expressions etc.

br
The following are wrong

span class="quote"

/span

br

span class="quote"

/span

br

br
But more importantly &quot;shall&quot;, in modern English, can simply be replaced with &quot;will&quot; on all occasions, otherwise you risk sounding pompous and archaic.

To improve readability, your sentence should actually not use &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;will&quot; but rather

I have neural network that loads stuff from file and then does the session and initialize variables. This is in the same function as the whole network model is in (As they share variables).
br

br
Then I have another .py that uses tkinter to draw images which I then save using PIL and then they go into the network.
br

br
So because of the sess variable(I believe) I can only do 1 image and then I need to close and start the .py again
br

br
So I wonder if I should re model my network so it work on multiple images when I start it or use threading.

I am dummy dum please no bully
Our .net project work has some unit test that work on every machine and server, except mine. They all crash because they can&#039;t find a .dll that comes with Blend, which I installed with Visual Studio 2017. The file is physically in the right directories, how can I tell VC to use it, without editing the project? (Since it works everywhere my PC is clearly at fault)
br
I tried reinstalling everything, no change

Is it correct to refer to my (single-process) application&#039;s maximum resident set size as its &quot;peak memory usage&quot;?

&quot;symbol-hell&quot; is something brainlets say when they&#039;re not familiar enough with a language. You probably think Haskell is symbol-hell too.

Ugly and symbol-hell are different concepts.

br
how? I think it&#039;s ugly because it&#039;s got fucking symbols all over the place, even if I know what they do, it&#039;s shit to read and more importantly it&#039;s shit to write

Because symbol-hell(see also: symbol-vomit) is in reference to the newbie incomprehensibility of densely symboled statements. Like 
pre class="prettyprint"
([&amp;]{/*blah blah*/}()[[]{/*blah blah*/}])
/pre
 
br

br
IE, you can have languages that are full of symbols that are attractive and languages that have no symbols that are ugly.

you said &quot;newbie incomprehensibility&quot;
br
it&#039;s still just as bad when you know what it does, you&#039;re just used to reading shitty syntax
br
I&#039;d like to know what languages exist that are full of symbols that aren&#039;t ugly
