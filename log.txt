I&#039;ve written a B-tree in C and I&#039;m having a bit of trouble extending
br
it to take arbitrary keys/values. Mostly, I&#039;m having trouble with freeing the values whenever a delete occurs. I figure I&#039;ve got two options: require the
br
user to provide a free function that&#039;s called automatically on deletes, or 
br
just have delete return a pointer to the deleted value and let the user free
br
it however they want.
br

br
Anyone have any advice?

a href="#p71687587" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71687587

The first sounds more straight forward and less prone to bugs due to hidden logic desu.

Copy the user&#039;s data into the tree yourself and manage your own memory so the user doesn&#039;t have to?

a href="#p71687619" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71687619
/a

br
Yes, be consistent. If the rest of your btree functions copy user data then the btree should free it. If the user provided reference is what is kept in the btree, then the user should be responsible for freeing it.

a href="#p71687639" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71687639
/a

br
If the guy&#039;s a bro he implements both and supports it by providing an option during btree creation.

if by two types, you mean lists and vectors, those are just two subtypes of sequence. as long as anything is a proper sequence, then it qualifies.

Yes you can, but it is quite a slow way to learn. Online tutorials and experimentation, and Googling issues you have while programming - this is from my experience the best and quickest way to learn how to program. Of course, once you know one language, it&#039;s easy to learn another language that&#039;s of a similar type. For example, you could learn Python to a decent level from a couple of YouTube videos once you know C++.

a href="#p71690455" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71690455

br
To advance through the list, set cur to point to the next entry.
br
If you want to e.g. add a new node at the end, assuming you&#039;re at the end of the list already, just call malloc and put the returned pointer as the pointer to next in the current node.
I want to start programming and have a feeling Python is a meme. Should I start with C?

br
Each node has some data and a pointer. And you have a pointer &quot;head&quot; which you use to access the first node.
br

br
Adding a node:
br
If there are no nodes, create a new node with a pointer to null. Point the head to that node.
br
If there is a node, create a new node with a pointer to what the head points to. Point the head to that node.
br

br
A node lives in some random part of memory and you can access it with pointers.

ok anon i might take a look at learn python the hard way and go from there.

br
The thing I am most concerned about is not learning programming properly, &quot;in depth&quot;. I really don&#039;t want to blindly follow solutions for the problems I will face while not fully understand what I&#039;m doing. For example, we have a Debian and a pfSense server at work and I usually have to solve random problems that happen, or to implement some systems, simple things, but I don&#039;t have the slightest clue of what I&#039;m doing, I just google the problem or what I want to do, solve it find another problem, google it again, solve it, rinse and repeat. I feel like working my way through a book will make me more aware of the intrinsics of the language.
Noob here, how do I find projects to contribute?

do you have previous programming experience? if so just use their python docs and their tutorials they&#039;re really good. python is extremely quick to learn if you already know another language.

malloc allocates from heap not stack.


If I&#039;m pretty fluent in C# and Java (roughly 2 years experience, maybe 5 years programming in general), how hard will it be to become decent at C++? I&#039;m taking a course that requires &quot;fluency in C++&quot; as a pre-requisite, and I have about a month to prepare.

a href="#p71691226" class="quotelink"

It&#039;s allocated on the heap.
br
Duplicating that statement
br

pre class="prettyprint"
int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
br
int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
br

/pre

br
would be bad because you&#039;d be declaring p twice. However if you did
br

pre class="prettyprint"
int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
br
*p = malloc(sizeof(int));
br

/pre

br
this would also be bad because you can no longer free the first block of memory. You no longer have a pointer to it.
br
But yes, you will have a new block of memory somewhere else on the heap.
How can I compile something with jsoncpp via Makefile? Already tried those two. Can&#039;t find anything in the docs either.

Basically, it depends on how it&#039;s installed. There&#039;s a default value it pulls from, but otherwise you have to specify if it isn&#039;t in that default location.

I have one, it&#039;s really fucking great.
reading on it is great. software is lacking many useful features like marking a book as read. For some reason does not load cover images on some files. Actually does not load any in my case and i have about 1500 mobis loaded on it. There are no profiles as far as I know. Software comes in many language versions but not in mine of course - lets support some exotic eastern gibberish and completely ignore the fact that kindle is the most popular ebook reader in one of european countries.

Shit. If you read in the sun anyway instead of friends you are a friendless loser and it&#039;s suitable for you. If you have a higher than 30 IQ, you&#039;ll realize that it&#039;s only good for reading &quot;fun&quot; books and sucks for PDF and research or information books.

A tablet is unironically the best, especially AMOLED for reading at night. If you read at your computer just turn your screen 90 degrees to read in 9:16, way better than 4:3 or 1:1.

That was the kindle with the keyboard, newer models have a touchscreen. Someone got the new kindle for my grandmother. It mainly uses gestures to turn pages and stuff. She was utterly confused by it, she thought the books I put on it were samples because after a few pages it would go back to the beginning. She couldn&#039;t read the whole book.

It&#039;s one of the best ereaders out there. It&#039;s 100% amazon botnet but this can be avoided if you never enable wifi, which I did. Why the fuck would I want wifi on an ereader, anyway? I download and transfer all my books using calibre, works good. It&#039;s also durable, I had a sony and a kobo before and both broke down on me. However, as any e ink reader it&#039;s painfully slow, I can&#039;t believe you have to wait for a second for a page to draw graphs or scroll PDFs  in 2019 when its cost is over 100$.
br

br
It does have some shit formatting presets when reading .epub or pdfs.

br
all in all it&#039;s the best ereader I used, but until they fix the speed issues that plague all ereaders it will still be lacking.

I got the Kindle Oasis 7&quot; for this.  I have only read what&#039;s on Kindle unlimited though (not much animu, mostly American stuff.)  The Amazon bought comics will zoom and read panel by panel so you can read everything.  I&#039;d say  7&quot; is the bare minimum but anything larger is very expensive.  I think one of the competitors is coming out with a 7&quot; for $200 soon if you don&#039;t want to support Amazon.
I have different e-readers with displays from 6&quot; to 8&quot;. The Kindle Oasis with 7&quot; is the most comfy one and by far my favorite.

Here&#039;s a quick and simple C version because why not.
br
Honestly I&#039;d prefer to have some empty string and then concatenate Fizz and Buzz to it respectively if it&#039;s divisible by 3 and 5, then just print the number if the string&#039;s empty.

The exercise is to count up to 100, if your code involves &quot;101&quot; to reach 100 then it&#039;s immediately less readable.

&gt;I&#039;m completely ignorant of how the range() built-in works so it&#039;s unreadable

&gt;&gt;71709003

br
So? It&#039;s not hard to encapsulate each step of a FizzBuzz to make it modular anyway.

pre class="prettyprint"
print(&#039; &#039;.join([&#039;fizz&#039;*(i%3==0) + &#039;buzz&#039;*(i%5==0) or str(i) for i in range (1, 101)]))
/pre


a href="#p71709042" class="quotelink"
&gt;&gt;71709042

br
Look, if the exercise requires you to count to 100 and you&#039;ve used something that only equates to an &quot;&lt; 101&quot; operator, then it was a poor choice.
